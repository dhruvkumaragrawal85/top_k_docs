Regulation varies in a given country depending on intended uses . # Controversy # Broad scientific consensus holds that food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food . The scientific rigor of the studies regarding human health has been disputed due to alleged lack of independence and due to conflicts of interest involving governing bodies and some of those who perform and evaluate the studies . GM crops provide a number of ecological benefits , but there are also concerns for their overuse , stalled research outside of the Bt seed industry , proper management and issues with Bt resistance arising from their misuse . Critics have objected to GM crops on ecological , economic and health grounds . The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law , mostly patents . The first generation of GM crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015 .

A 1999 study found that in a lab environment , pollen from Bt maize dusted onto milkweed could harm the monarch butterfly . Several groups later studied the phenomenon in both the field and the laboratory , resulting in a risk assessment that concluded that any risk posed by the corn to butterfly populations under real-world conditions was negligible . A 2002 review of the scientific literature concluded that the commercial large-scale cultivation of current Btmaize hybrids did not pose a significant
