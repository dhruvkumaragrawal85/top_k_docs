containing thousands of nanowires , able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells , could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient 's blood . The basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts : a ) efficient encapsulation of the drugs , b ) successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body , and c ) successful release of that drug there . Researchers at Rice University under Prof. Jennifer West , have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice . The nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface . By irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser , which passes through flesh without heating it , the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells . Limitations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lack of solubility . Nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems . Nanoparticles of cadmium selenide ( quantum dots ) glow when exposed to ultraviolet light . When injected , they seep into cancer tumors . The surgeon can see the glowing tumor , and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal . In photodynamic therapy , a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside . The light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal , energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue . Light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with
