deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells . Using a mouse model , scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant ' ' in vivo ' ' . *Nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model . Researchers in the North Carolina State University designed this nanoparticle , called Gelipo , to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both . The cross-linked hyaluronic acid ( HA ) shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide . HA preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase ( HAase ) rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes . When the HAase degrades the gel shell of Gelipo , the TRAIL protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis ( cell death ) . The core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes , the cellular transport system . The peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly , maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects . # Protein and peptide delivery # Protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders . These macromolecules are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and Dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics , and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals. # #Applications and reported research studies#
