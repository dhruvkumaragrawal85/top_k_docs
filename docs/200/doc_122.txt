, were injected intravenously . In the region of vessel narrowing , shear stresses dissociate the aggregates and release the tPA-coated nanoparticles which bind and degrade the blood clots . By prcised targeting and concentrating drug at the location of obstruction , the dose used is less than 1/50th of the normal dose . The nanotherapeutics will greatly reduce the severe side effect of bleeding , commonly found in standard treatment of thrombosis . *An early phase clinical trial using the platform of Minicell nanoparticle for drug delivery have been tested on patients with advanced and untreatable cancer . Built from the membranes of mutant bacteria , the minicells were loaded with paclitaxel and coated with cetuximab , antibodies that bind the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) which is often overexpressed in a number of cancers , as a ' homing ' device to the tumor cells . The tumor cells recognize the bacteria from which the minicells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engulf it . Once inside , the payload of anti-cancer drug kills the tumor cells . Measured at 400 nanometers , the minicell is bigger than synthetic particles developed for drug delivery . The researchers indicated that this larger size gives the minicells a better profile in side-effects because the minicells will preferentially leak out of the porous blood vessels around the tumor cells and do not reach the liver , digestive system and skin . This Phase 1 clinical trial demonstrated that this treatment is well tolerated by the patients . As a platform technology , the minicell drug delivery system can be used to treat a number of different cancers with different anti-cancer drugs with the benefit of lower dose and less side-effects . *Researchers at The Methodist
