time which is better for the patients . It is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair . # Diagnostic and medical devices # Nanotechnology-on-a-chip is one more dimension of lab-on-a-chip technology . Magnetic nanoparticles , bound to a suitable antibody , are used to label specific molecules , structures or microorganisms . Gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of DNA can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample . Multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different-sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads . Nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures . *C-dots ( Cornell dots ) are the smallest silica-based nanoparticles with the size **62628;7509;10 scriptstyle x </math> is given and the cost function to be minimized , that can be any function of the data <math> scriptstyle x </math> and the network 's output , <math> scriptstyle f </math> . The cost function is dependent on the task ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a priori ' ' assumptions ( the implicit properties of our model , its parameters and the observed variables ) . As a trivial example , consider the model <math> scriptstyle f(x) = a </math> where <math> scriptstyle a </math> is a constant and the cost <math> scriptstyle C=E ( x - f(x)2 </math> . Minimizing this cost will give us a value of <math> scriptstyle a </math> that is equal to the mean of the data . The cost function can be much more complicated . Its form depends on the application : for example , in compression it could be related to the mutual information between <math> scriptstyle x </math> and <math>
