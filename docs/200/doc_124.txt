and femur , researchers from Pennsylvania State University and Boston University used nanoparticles of polylactic-coglycolic acid ( widely used in medical devices ) carrying sodium alendronate ( an osteoporosis drug ) for the ' ' in vitro ' ' experiments and found the ' nanotrucks ' successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone . *Nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule . Clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50-100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload . Experiments by researchers in Northwestern University on mouse models with chemotherapy-resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone . The nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , once inside the tumor , the nanoparticles are retained much longer . Additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple-negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin . Increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models . UCLA reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine . The nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears . The drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down . *In regenerative medicine research , silica based nanoparticles are used to
