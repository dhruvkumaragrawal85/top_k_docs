Hospital Research Institute in Houston have created ' LeukoLike Vectors ' or LLVs . LLVs are the drug-carrying silicon nanoparticles coated with the lipoprotein removed from the membranes of the white blood cells , leukocytes . The ' cloaked ' nanoparticles were found to behave like leukocytes , are able to evade the body 's immune system and survive much longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scientists expressed that LLVs are able to overcome a major hurdle in nanomedicine delivery by avoiding clearance in blood stream , crossing the biological barriers and localizing at target tissues due to its leukocyte like characters . Synthetic membranes are expected to develop in the future to replace harvest from the white blood cells due to the limited source of leukocyte. *Inhalable nanocarriers were developed using a nanostructured lipid nanocarrier-based system ( NLCS ) . The lipid nanoparticles contain the drug payload ( doxorubicin or paclitaxel ) ; two types of small interfering RNA ( siRNA , targeted the BCL-2 mRNA to suppress nonpump cellular resistance , and MRP1 mRNA to suppress pump drug resistance ) ; and the targeting molecules , an analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) which homes in the overexpressed receptors of the cancer cells . The disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer . Results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment . *Self-powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ion gradients generated by leaked minerals ( ions ) from the bone , and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing .
