medicine and the medical field . Nanomedicine is a large industry , with nanomedicine sales reaching $6.8 billion in 2004 , and with over 200 companies and 38 products worldwide , a minimum of $3.8 billion in nanotechnology R&amp;D is being invested every year . As the nanomedicine industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant impact on the economy . # Medical use of nanomaterials # Two forms of nanomedicine that have already been tested in mice and are awaiting human trials that will be using gold nanoshells to help diagnose and treat cancer , and using liposomes as vaccine adjuvants and as vehicles for drug transport . Similarly , drug detoxification is also another application for nanomedicine which has shown promising results in rats . A benefit of using nanoscale for medical technologies is that smaller devices are less invasive and can possibly be implanted inside the body , plus biochemical reaction times are much shorter . These devices are faster and more sensitive than typical drug delivery . Advances in Lipid nanotechnology was also instrumental in engineering medical nanodevices and novel drug delivery systems as well as in developing sensing applications . # Drug delivery # Nanotechnology has provided the possibility of delivering drugs to specific cells using nanoparticles . The overall drug consumption and side-effects may be lowered significantly by depositing the active agent in the morbid region only and in no higher dose than needed . This highly selective approach would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in dendrimers and nanoporous materials . Another example is to use block co-polymers , which form micelles for drug encapsulation . They could hold small drug molecules transporting them to the desired location . Another vision is based on
