small electromechanical systems ; nanoelectromechanical systems are being investigated for the active release of drugs . Some potentially important applications include cancer treatment with iron nanoparticles or gold shells . Targeted drug delivery is intended to reduce the side effects of drugs with concomitant decreases in consumption and treatment expenses . The increased efficiency of delivery results in overall societal benefit by reducing the amount of drug needed in an equipotent preparation of said therapy , and thus reduced cost to the consumer . Nanomedical approaches to drug delivery center on developing nanoscale particles or molecules to improve drug bioavailability . Bioavailability refers to the presence of drug molecules where they are needed in the body and where they will do the most good . Drug delivery focuses on maximizing bioavailability both at specific places in the body and over a period of time . This can potentially be achieved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeting the molecules and delivering drugs with cell precision . More than $65 billion are wasted each year due to poor bioavailability . ' ' In vivo ' ' imaging is another area where tools and devices are being developed . Using nanoparticle contrast agents , images such as ultrasound and MRI have a favorable distribution and improved contrast . The new methods of nanoengineered materials that are being developed might be effective in treating illnesses and diseases such as cancer . What nanoscientists will be able to achieve in the future is beyond current imagination . This might be accomplished by self assembled biocompatible nanodevices that will detect , evaluate , treat and report to the clinical doctor automatically . Drug delivery systems , lipid- or polymer-based nanoparticles , can be designed to improve the pharmacological and therapeutic
