Furthermore , researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 ) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning , as well as shallow vs deep architecture . Some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models ( combining neural networks and symbolic approaches ) . They advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind ( Sun and Bookman , 1990 ) . **22;70143;gallery **25;70167;TOOLONG single-layer feedforward artificial neural network .

He works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman , and is Asterix 's best friend . Obelix is noted for his fatness , the menhirs he carries around on his back and his superhuman strength . He is the only Gaul in Asterix 's village who is permanently superhumanly strong since he fell into a cauldron
