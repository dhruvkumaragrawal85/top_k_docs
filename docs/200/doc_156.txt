The purpose of the brain is to collect information from the body ( pain , hunger , etc. ) , and from the outside world , interpret it to a coherent world view , and produce a meaningful response . The information from the senses enter the brain in the primary sensory areas . They process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information is interpreted . Spontaneous activity in the primary sensory areas may produce hallucinations , which the secondary areas misinterpret as information from the real world . For example , a PET or fMRI scan of a person who claims he hears voices may show activation in the primary auditory cortex , or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech . Tertiary brain cortex collects the interpretations from the secondary cortexes and creates a coherent world view of it . A study investigating structural changes in the brains of people with psychosis showed there was significant grey matter reduction in the right medial temporal , lateral temporal , and inferior frontal gyrus , and in the cingulate cortex bilaterally of people before and after they became psychotic . Findings such as these have led to debate about whether psychosis itself causes excitotoxic brain damage and whether potentially damaging changes to the brain are related to the length of psychotic episode . Recent research has suggested that this is not the case although further investigation is still ongoing . Studies with sensory deprivation have shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to function properly . If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses , loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours . A similar
