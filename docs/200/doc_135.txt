networks could predict the outcome for a patient with colorectal cancer with more accuracy than the current clinical methods . After training , the networks could predict multiple patient outcomes from unrelated institutions . # Neural networks and neuroscience # Theoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and the computational modeling of biological neural systems . Since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behavior , the field is closely related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work . To gain this understanding , neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes ( data ) , biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning ( biological neural network models ) and theory ( statistical learning theory and information theory ) . # #Types of models# # Many models are used in the field , defined at different levels of abstraction and modeling different aspects of neural systems . They range from models of the short-term behavior of individual neurons , models of how the dynamics of neural circuitry arise from interactions between individual neurons and finally to models of how behavior can arise from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems . These include models of the long-term , and short-term plasticity , of neural systems and their relations to learning and memory from the individual neuron to the system level . # Neural network software # Neural network software is used to simulate , research , develop and apply artificial neural networks , biological neural networks and , in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Types of artificial neural networks # Artificial neural network types
