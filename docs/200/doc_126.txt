# *Nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis . Biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse 's immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system . Team of researchers in Northwestern University indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases . *Researchers at UCLA developed a nanoparticle system with water-soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus , apoptin . Apoptin selectively sends self-destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) as it builds up in the nucleus , while leaving healthy cells unharmed . In the mouse model of human breast cancer , the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth . This new form of treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harming healthy cells , a common pitfall of chemotherapy , and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy . *A nano-network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin , modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with Type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days . The nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan ( from shrimp shells ) or negatively charged alginate ( from seaweed ) . The opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano-network even after they are injected subcutaneously . The porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores . When there is high blood
