and nanoscience will be in leading development of completely new drugs with more useful behavior and less side effects . Polymeric nano-particles are a competing technology to lipidic ( based mainly on Phospholipids ) nano-particles . There is an additional risk of toxicity associated with polymers not widely studied or understood . This toxicity could include ( but not limited to ) hepatotoxicity , nephrotoxicity etc. and can have long term impacts not easily evaluated in short term in-vivo clinical trials either in animals or humans . Since the degradation of polymers to either their monomers or other degradation products in the body can not be accurately predicted ( unclear metabolic pathway ) , this is a real risk , specially in medicines intended for long term patient use . Even if the toxicity is ignored , there is additional hepatic load of metabolism , again an area of concern for long term medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost and predictable characterisation , so the formulation chemists prefer this . However , in the patient 's body this very stability ( slow degradation ) is a negative factor . Phospholipids on the other hand are membrane lipids ( already present in the body and surrounding each cell ) , have a GRAS ( Generally Recognised As Safe ) status from FDA and are derived from natural sources without any complex chemistry involved . They are not metabolised but rather absorbed by the body and the degradation products are themselves nutrients ( fats or micronutrients ) . It is greatly observed that nanoparticles are promising tools for the advancement of drug delivery , medical imaging , and as diagnostic sensors . However , the biodistribution of these nanoparticles is still imperfect due to the complex
