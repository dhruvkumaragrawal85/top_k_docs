host 's reactions to nano- and microsized materials <sup> 14 </sup> and the difficulty in targeting specific organs in the body . Nevertheless , a lot of work is still ongoing to optimize and better understand the potential and limitations of nanoparticulate systems . For example , current research in the excretory systems of mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs based on their size and charge . These composites are encapsulated by a dendrimer and assigned a specific charge and size . Positively-charged gold nanoparticles were found to enter the kidneys while negatively-charged gold nanoparticles remained in the liver and spleen . It is suggested that the positive surface charge of the nanoparticle decreases the rate of opsonization of nanoparticles in the liver , thus affecting the excretory pathway . Even at a relatively small size of 5 nm , though , these particles can become compartmentalized in the peripheral tissues , and will therefore accumulate in the body over time . While advancement of research proves that targeting and distribution can be augmented by nanoparticles , the dangers of nanotoxicity become an important next step in further understanding of their medical uses . Nanoparticles are also used to circumvent multidrug resistance ( MDR ) mechanisms . Mechanisms of MDR include decreased uptake of drugs , reduced intracellular drug concentration by activation of the efflux transporters , modifications in cellular pathways by altering cell cycle checkpoints , increased metabolism of drugs , induced emergency response genes to impair apoptotic pathways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research studies# # *Abraxane , approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) to treat breast cancer , non-small- cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and pancreatic cancer , is the
