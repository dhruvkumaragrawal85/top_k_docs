phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly , when poor eyesight , hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment . On the other hand , loss from reality may also occur if the spontaneous cortical activity is increased so that it is no longer counterbalanced with information from the senses . The 5-HT2A receptor seems to be important for this , since psychedelic drugs that activate them produce hallucinations . However , the main feature of psychosis is not hallucinations , but the inability to distinguish between internal and external stimuli . Close relatives to psychotic patients may hear voices , but since they are aware that they are unreal they can ignore them , so that the hallucinations do not affect their reality perception . Hence they are not considered psychotic . Psychosis has been traditionally linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine . In particular , the dopamine hypothesis of psychosis has been influential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the brain , particularly in the mesolimbic pathway . The two major sources of evidence given to support this theory are that dopamine receptor D2 blocking drugs ( i.e. , antipsychotics ) tend to reduce the intensity of psychotic symptoms , and that drugs that boost dopamine activity ( such as amphetamines and cocaine ) can trigger psychosis in some people ( see amphetamine psychosis ) . However , increasing evidence in recent times has pointed to a possible dysfunction of the excitory neurotransmitter glutamate , in particular , with the activity of the NMDA receptor . This theory is reinforced by the fact that dissociative NMDA receptor antagonists such as ketamine , PCP and dextromethorphan ( at large overdoses ) induce a psychotic state more readily than dopaminergic stimulants ,
