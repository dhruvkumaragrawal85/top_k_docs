and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them ( like tumors ) . This therapy is appealing for many reasons . It does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body ( chemotherapy ) because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist . Photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases , growth and tumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform , by targeting specific tumor cells , tissues and organs . Actually , Conde et al . reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic siRNA silencing via RGD-nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model . This study reported the use of siRNA/RGD gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models , resulting in successful and significant ' ' c-Myc ' ' oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals . This delivery system can achieve translocation of siRNA duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression . Actually , RGD/siRNA-AuNPs can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3-receptor-mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity , showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered ' ' c-Myc ' ' siRNA to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis. # Surgery # At Rice University , a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece . The two pieces of chicken are placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dribbled along the seam . An infrared laser is traced along the seam , causing the two sides to
