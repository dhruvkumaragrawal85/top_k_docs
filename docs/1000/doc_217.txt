Thunderbolt II used by the United States Air Force . 25 mm DU rounds have been used in the M242 gun mounted on the U.S. Army 's Bradley Fighting Vehicle and the Marine Corp 's LAV-25 . The U.S. Marine Corps uses DU in the 25 mm PGU-20 round fired by the GAU-12 Equalizer cannon of the AV-8B Harrier , and also in the 20 mm M197 gun mounted on AH-1 Cobra helicopter gunships . The United States Navy 's Phalanx CIWS 's M61 Vulcan Gatling gun used 20 mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding plastic sabots made using depleted uranium , later changed to tungsten . Another use of depleted uranium is in kinetic energy penetrators , anti-armor rounds such as the 120 mm sabot rounds fired from the British Challenger 1 , Challenger 2 , M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams . Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long , relatively thin penetrator surrounded by a discarding sabot . Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals , usually titanium or molybdenum . One formulation has a composition of 99.25% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titanium . Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in kinetic energy penetrator armor-piercing ammunition . The US Army uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium . According to 2005 research , at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions , such as tungsten-cobalt or tungsten-nickel-cobalt alloys , also possess extreme carcinogenic properties , which by far exceed those ( confirmed or suspected ) of depleted uranium itself : 100% of rats implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed
