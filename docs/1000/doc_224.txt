in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds . The Institute of Nuclear Technology-Radiation Protection of Attiki , Greece , has noted that the aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel . The utilisation of DU in incendiary ammunition is controversial because of potential adverse health effects and its release into the environment . In early 2004 , the UK Pensions Appeal Tribunal Service attributed birth defect claims from a February 1991 Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 2005 epidemiology review concluded : In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU . Studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents continue to suggest the possibility of leukemogenic , genetic , reproductive , and neurological effects from chronic exposure . # Chemical toxicity # The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater ' ' in vitro ' ' than its radiological hazard , with the kidney considered to be the main target organ . . Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external . Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur : inhalation , ingestion , and embedded fragments or shrapnel contamination . Properties such as phase ( e.g. particulate or gaseous ) , oxidation state ( e.g. metallic or ceramic ) , and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their absorption , distribution , translocation , elimination and the resulting toxicity . For example , metallic uranium is less toxic compared to hexavalent @
