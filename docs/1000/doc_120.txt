nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel. *Doxil was originally approved by the FDA for the use on HIV-related Kaposi 's sarcoma . It is now being used to also treat ovarian cancer and multiple myeloma . The drug is encased in liposomes , which helps to extend the life of the drug that is being distributed . Liposomes are self-assembling , spherical , closed colloidal structures that are composed of lipid bilayers that surround an aqueous space . The liposomes also help to increase the functionality and it helps to decrease the damage that the drug does to the heart muscles specifically . *In a mice study , scientists from Rice University and University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center reported enhanced effectiveness and reduced toxicity of an existing treatment for head and neck cancer when using the nanoparticles to deliver the drug . The hydrophilic carbonic clusters functionalized with polyethylene glycol or PEG-HCC are mixed with the chemotherapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receptor ( EGFR ) targeted Cetuximab and injected intravenously . They found the tumors were killed more effectively with radiation and the healthy tissue suffered less toxicity than without the nanotechnology drug delivery . The standard treatment contains Cremophor EL which allows the hydrophobic paclitaxel to be delivered intravenously . Replacing the toxic Cremophor with carbon nanoparticles eliminated its side effect and improved drug targeting which in turn required a lower dose of the toxic paclitaxel. *Researchers at Case Western Reserve University reported using nanoparticle chain to deliver doxorubicin to breast cancer cells in a mice study . Three magnetic , iron-oxide nanospheres were chemically linked to one doxorubicin-loaded liposome and formed a 100 nm long nanoparticle chain . After the nanochains penetrated the tumor , radiofrequency field was generated that caused the
