According to anarcho-primitivism , the shift from hunter-gatherer to agricultural subsistence gave rise to social stratification , coercion , and alienation . Anarcho-primitivists advocate a return to non- civilized ways of life through deindustrialisation , abolition of the division of labour or specialization , and abandonment of large-scale organization technologies .
