therapy , cardiazol shock therapy , and electroconvulsive therapy . Despite considerable risk , shock therapy was considered highly efficacious in the treatment of psychosis including schizophrenia . The acceptance of high-risk treatments led to more invasive medical interventions including psychosurgery . In 1888 , Swiss psychiatrist , Gottlieb Burckhardt , performed the first medically sanctioned psychosurgery in which the cerebral cortex was excised . Although some patients showed improvement of symptoms and became more subdued , one patient died and several developed aphasia and/or seizure disorders . Burckhardt would go on to publish his clinical outcomes in a scholarly paper . This procedure was met with criticism from the medical community and his academic and surgical endeavors were largely ignored . In the late 1930s , Egas Moniz conceived the leucotomy ( AKA prefrontal lobotomy ) in which the fibers connecting the frontal lobes to the rest of the brain were severed . Monizs primary inspiration stemmed from a demonstration by neuroscientists , John Fulton and Carlyles 1935 experiment in which two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was compared . Prior to the leucotomy , the chimps engaged in typical behavior including throwing feces and fighting . After the procedure , both chimps were pacified and less violent . During the Q&amp;A , Moniz asked if such a procedure could be extended to human subjects , a question that Fulton admitted was quite startling . Moniz would go on to extend the controversial practice to humans suffering from various psychotic disorders , an endeavor for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1949 . Between the late 1930s and early 1970s , the leucotomy was a widely accepted practice , often performed in non-sterile environments such as small outpatient clinics and patient homes .
