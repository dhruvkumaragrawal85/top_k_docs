# Gases and fill pressure # Depending on the size , type , and application of the flashtube , gas fill pressures may range from a few kilopascals to hundreds of kilopascals ( 0.014.0 atmospheres or tens to thousands of torr ) . Generally , the higher the pressure , the greater the output efficiency . Xenon is used mostly because of its good efficiency , converting nearly 50% of electrical energy into light . Krypton , on the other hand , is only about 40% efficient , but at low currents is a better match to the absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the amount of gas behind the electrodes , or the dead volume . A higher dead volume leads to a lower pressure increase during operation . # Operation # The electrodes of the lamp are usually connected to a capacitor , which is charged to a relatively high voltage ( generally between 250 and 5000 volts ) , using a step up transformer and a rectifier . The gas , however , exhibits extremely high resistance , and the lamp will not conduct electricity until the gas is ionized . Once ionized , or triggered , a spark will form between the electrodes , allowing the capacitor to discharge . The sudden surge of electric current quickly heats the gas to a plasma state , where electrical resistance becomes very low . There are several methods of triggering . # External triggering # External triggering is the most common method of operation , especially for photographic use . The electrodes are charged to a voltage high enough to respond to triggering , but below the lamp 's self-flash threshold . An extremely high voltage pulse , ( usually between 2000
