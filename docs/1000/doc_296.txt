Rodovia Professor Zeferino Vaz * Rodovia Jornalista Francisco Aguirre Proena All these motorways are built according to the highest international standards ( see highway system of So Paulo ) . The Anel Virio Jos Magalhes Teixeira ( SP-038 ) around the city currently interconnects the Anhangera and Dom Pedro I motorways . Campinas has long been a major railway hub , too , although passenger train lines no longer operate there . The city built a light rail line in the early-1990s , but due to low ridership the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city is Viracopos International Airport , located 14 km from downtown Campinas and 99 km from the city of So Paulo , and can be reached by three motorways : Santos Dumont , Bandeirantes and Anhanguera . Because of the size and wealth of the regional population around Campinas , and its industrial sector which relies strongly on importation and exportation , the airport today is one of the airport 's operator ( Infraero ) highest priorities to receive investments . Due to the operation of several passenger airlines , such as TAM Airlines , Gol Airlines , Trip Airlines and , more recently , Azul Airlines , which has made Viracopos as its main national hub , the airport is now also the third in the ranking of highest passenger movement in the state of So Paulo . A fast train line is planned for connecting the capital city of So Paulo to the Viracopos airport , thus enhancing its importance in the air transportation in Brazil . A second facility , Campo dos Amarais Airport located 8 km from downtown Campinas , is dedicated to general aviation . # @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
