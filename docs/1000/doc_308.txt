inert pair effect and is commonly linked to relativistic stabilisation of the 6s-orbitals . It is expected that ununpentium will continue this trend and portray only +III and +I oxidation states . Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and ununpentium(I) is likely to show some unique properties . Because of spin-orbit coupling , flerovium may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties ; if this is the case , ununpentium will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <sup> + </sup> will have the same electron configuration as flerovium. # Chemistry # Ununpentium should display eka-bismuth chemical properties and should therefore form a sesquioxide , Uup <sub> 2 </sub> Oxygen # Stability # All the reported above isotopes of element 115 , obtained by nuclear collisions of lighter nuclei , are severely neutron-deficient , because the proportion of neutrons to protons needed for maximum stability increases with atomic number . The most stable isotope will probably be <sup> 299 </sup> Uup , with 184 neutrons , a known magic closed-shell number conferring exceptional stability , making it ( with one further proton outside the magic number of 114 protons ) both the chemical and the nuclear homolog of <sup> 209 </sup> Bi ; but the technology required to add the required neutrons presently does not exist . This is because no known combination of target and projectile can result in the required neutrons . It has been suggested that such a neutron-rich isotope could be formed by quasifission ( fusion followed by fission ) of a massive nucleus , multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would depend on the stability of the parent nuclei towards spontaneous fission ) . @@78514 In
