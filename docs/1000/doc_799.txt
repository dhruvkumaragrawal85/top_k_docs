it has the same multiset of eigenvalues , and since it is triangular , those eigenvalues are the diagonal entries of ' ' U ' ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' ' A ' ' -invariant subspaces 0 = ' ' V ' ' <sub> 0 </sub> ' ' V ' ' <sub> 1 </sub> .. ' ' V <sub> n </sub> ' ' = C <sup> ' ' n ' ' </sup> , and that there exists an ordered orthonormal basis ( for the standard Hermitian form of C <sup> ' ' n ' ' </sup> ) such that the first ' ' i ' ' basis vectors span ' ' V ' ' <sub> ' ' i ' ' </sub> for each ' ' i ' ' occurring in the nested sequence . Phrased somewhat differently , the first part says that a linear operator ' ' J ' ' on a complex finite-dimensional vector space stabilizes a complete flag ( ' ' V ' ' <sub> 1 </sub> , ... , ' ' V <sub> n </sub> ' ' ) . # Proof # A constructive proof for the Schur decomposition is as follows : every operator ' ' A ' ' on a complex finite-dimensional vector space has an eigenvalue ' ' &amp;lambda ; ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; </sub> ' ' . Let ' ' V <sub> &amp;lambda ; </sub> ' ' <sup> </sup> be its orthogonal complement . It is clear that , with respect to this orthogonal decomposition , ' ' A ' ' has matrix representation ( one can pick here any orthonormal bases ' ' Z <sub> 1 </sub> ' ' and ' ' Z
