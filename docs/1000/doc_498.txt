said to be either ' accepted ' or ' declined . ' If a player who is offered a gambit captures the piece ( and thus gains material ) the gambit is said to be accepted . If the player who was offered the gambit ignores it and instead continues his or her development , then the gambit is said to be declined . In modern chess , the typical response to a moderately sound gambit is to accept the material and give the material back at an advantageous time . For gambits that are less sound , the accepting player is more likely to try to hold onto his extra material . A rule of thumb often found in various primers on chess suggests that a player should get three moves ( see tempo ) of development for a sacrificed pawn , but it is unclear how useful this general maxim is since the free moves part of the compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , a player is not obliged to accept a gambit . Often , a gambit can be declined without disadvantage . # Soundness # A gambit is said to be ' sound ' if it is capable of procuring some concession from the opponent . There are three general criteria in which a gambit is often said to be sound : *Time gain : the player accepting the gambit must take time to procure the sacrificed material and possibly must use more time to reorganize his pieces after the material is taken . *Generation of differential activity : Often a player accepting a gambit will decentralize his pieces or pawns and his poorly placed pieces will allow the gambiteer to place his own pieces and pawns
