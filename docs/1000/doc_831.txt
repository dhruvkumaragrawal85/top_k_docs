radiation ( an arc that produces mostly continuum emission , but is still mostly transparent to its own light ) . For xenon , greybody radiation is centered near green , and produces the right combination for white light . Greybody radiation is produced at densities above 2400 A/cm <sup> 2 </sup> . Current densities that are very high , approaching 4000 A/cm <sup> 2 </sup> , tend to favor black-body radiation . As current densities become even higher , xenon 's output spectrum will begin to settle on that of a blackbody radiator with a color temperature of 9800 kelvins ( a rather sky-blue shade of white ) . Blackbody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation from within the arc can be absorbed before reaching the surface , impairing output efficiency . Due to its high efficient white output , xenon is used extensively for photographic applications , despite its great expense . In lasers , spectral line emission is usually favored , as these lines tend to better match absorption lines of the lasing media . Krypton is also occasionally used , although it is even more expensive . At low current densities , krypton 's spectral line output in the near-IR range is better matched to the absorption profile of neodymium based laser media than xenon emission , and very closely matches the narrow absorption profile of Nd:YAG. # Krypton and other gases # All gases produce spectral lines which are specific to the gas , superimposed on a background of continuum radiation . With all gases , low current densities produce mostly spectral lines , with the highest output being concentrated in the near-IR between 650 and 1000 nm . Krypton 's strongest peaks are around 760 and 810 nm .
