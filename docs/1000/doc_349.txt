and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life . The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner ( real name of Han Ryner ) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI , ( Federacin Anarquista Ibrica ) . This ecological tendency in Spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the CNTFAI in Spain . Daniel Gurin in ' ' Anarchism : From Theory to Practice ' ' reports : # # Isaac Puente # # Isaac Puente was an influential Spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s and an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism , was a militant of both the CNT anarcho-syndicalist trade union and Iberian Anarchist Federation . He published the book ' ' El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims ' ' ) in 1933 , which sold around 100,000 copies , and wrote the final document for the Extraordinary Confederal Congress of Zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the CNT for that year . Puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view . He saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes , alongside Neo-Malthusianism , and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being . He believed capitalist societies endangered the well-being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint , and promoted anarcho-communism alongside naturism as a solution . # # Other countries # # Naturism also met anarchism in the United Kingdom . In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s
