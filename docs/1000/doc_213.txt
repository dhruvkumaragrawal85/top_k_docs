in humans due to DU exposure . # History # Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the United States and Britain began their nuclear weapons programs . Later in the decade , France and the Soviet Union began their nuclear weapons and nuclear power programs . It was at this time that depleted uranium was first stored as an unusable waste product ( uranium hexafluoride ) . There was some hope that the enrichment process would be improved and fissionable isotopes of U-235 could , at some future date , be extracted from the depleted uranium . This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 contained in the depleted uranium is no longer a matter of the future : it has been practiced for several years . Also , it is possible to design civilian power-generating reactors using unenriched fuel , but only about 10%cite print In the 1970s , the Pentagon reported that the Soviet military had developed armor plating for Warsaw Pact tanks that NATO ammunition could not penetrate .

The US and NATO militaries used DU penetrator rounds in the 1991 Gulf War , the Bosnia war , While clearing a decades-old Hawaii firing range in 2005 , workers found depleted uranium fins from training rounds from the formerly classified Davy Crockett recoilless gun tactical battlefield nuclear delivery system from the 1960s and 1970s . These training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before DU had become an item of interest , more than 20 years before the Gulf War . # Production and availability # Natural uranium metal
