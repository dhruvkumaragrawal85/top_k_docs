New wings have been built in recent years . These have been funded by the Private Finance Initiative ( PFI ) . The PFI is a scheme where the Government contract a private company to design , build , finance and manage a hospital , school , prison or other public service . The company that does this is usually given a 30 year contract . The company that is contracted at Stoke Mandeville Hospital is the multinational Sodexho . Sodexho is also contracted to provide housekeeping , domestics , catering , vending , portering , non-emergency patient transport , telecommunications , car parking , security , maintenance , help desk ( non-technical ) and switchboard . All of the portering , catering , domestic , maintenance , security and help desk staff are employed by Sodexho rather than the NHS Trust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ # Historic sexual abuse at the hospital # Dr Michael Salmon , consultant paediatrician at Stoke Mandeville hospital , was convicted and jailed for three years in 1990 for indecent assaults on teenaged girl patients , two thirteen year olds and
