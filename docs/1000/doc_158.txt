even at normal recreational doses . The symptoms of dissociative intoxication are also considered to mirror the symptoms of schizophrenia , including negative psychotic symptoms , more closely than amphetamine psychosis . Dissociative induced psychosis happens on a more reliable and predictable basis than amphetamine psychosis , which usually only occurs in cases of overdose , prolonged use or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New antipsychotic drugs that act on glutamate and its receptors are currently undergoing clinical trials . The connection between dopamine and psychosis is generally believed complex . While dopamine receptor D2 suppresses adenylate cyclase activity , the D1 receptor increases it . If D2-blocking drugs are administered the blocked dopamine spills over to the D1 receptors . The increased adenylate cyclase activity affects genetic expression in the nerve cell , which takes time . Hence antipsychotic drugs take a week or two to reduce the symptoms of psychosis . Moreover , newer and equally effective antipsychotic drugs actually block slightly less dopamine in the brain than older drugs whilst also blocking 5-HT2A receptors , suggesting the ' dopamine hypothesis ' may be oversimplified . Soyka and colleagues found no evidence of dopaminergic dysfunction in people with alcohol-induced psychosis and Zoldan et al . reported moderately successful use of ondansetron , a 5-HT <sub> 3 </sub> receptor antagonist , in the treatment of levodopa psychosis in Parkinson 's disease patients . Psychiatrist David Healy has criticised pharmaceutical companies for promoting simplified biological theories of mental illness that seem to imply the primacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are known important influences in the aetiology of psychosis . Some theories believe many psychotic symptoms are a problem with the perception of ownership of internally generated thoughts and experiences
