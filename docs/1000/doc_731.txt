JT8D higher-bypass engines drove early studies including designs known as Series 55 , Series 50 ( re-fanned Super Stretch ) , and Series 60 . The design effort focused on the Series 55 in August 1977 . With the projected entry into service in 1980 , the design was marketed as the ' ' DC-9 Series 80 ' ' . Swissair launched the Series 80 in October 1977 with an order for 15 plus an option for five . The Series 80 featured a fuselage 14ft3in m longer than the DC-9-50 .

The MD-80 series aircraft also have longer fuselages than their earlier ' ' DC-9 ' ' counterparts , as well as longer range . Some customers , such as American Airlines , still refer to the planes in fleet documentation as Super 80 . This model is still flown extensively by American Airlines and Delta Air Lines .
