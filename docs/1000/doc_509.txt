floating pennywort , a highly invasive weed , which cuts off all light to the river bed , reducing oxygen levels and resulting in a poor habitat for fish . The Ember flood relief channel has a diverse fish population , including chub , dace , roach , bleak , large pike and barbel . At the confluence of the Mole and the River Thames at Hampton Court Palace it is possible to catch a wide variety of coarse fish species . The geographical distribution of many species of invertebrate in the river reflects the geology of the catchment area . Viviparid snails and water scorpions ( of the genus ' ' Nepidae ' ' ) are commonly found where the river runs over the London Clay . Crayfish are common in areas associated with high alkalinity particularly around Brockham and the tributaries which run over the Wealden Clay provide an excellent habitat for stoneflies , caddisflies , fast swimming mayflies and riffle beetles . The Beautiful Demoiselle ( ' ' Calopteryx virgo ' ' ) disappeared from the River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has since recolonised . The White-legged Damselfly ( ' ' Platycnemis pennipes ' ' ) is also found along the river and the Downy Emerald ( ' ' Cordulia aenea ' ' ) is found between Box Hill and Leatherhead . The Mole is one of only three locations in England where the River Shingle Beetle ' ' Meotica anglica ' ' is found . A nationally scarce species which is locally common on the River Mole is the Greater Dodder ' ' Cuscuta europaea ' ' . # Conservation # The Mole catchment area includes twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSIs ) which include wetland habitats
