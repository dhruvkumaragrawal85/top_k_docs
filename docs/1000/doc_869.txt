workings of this part of the atmosphere . Using this theory and further experiments , he showed that the so-called Kennelly-Heaviside layer was heavily ionised and thus conducting . This led to the term ionosphere . He showed free electrons to be the ionising agents . He discovered that the layer could be penetrated by waves above a certain frequency and that this critical frequency could be used to calculate the electron density in the layer . However these penetrating waves would also be reflected back , but from a much higher layer . This showed the ionosphere had a much more complex structure than first anticipated . The lower level was labelled E Layer , reflected longer wavelengths and was found to be at approximately 125 km . The high level , which had much higher electron density , was labelled F Layer and could reflect much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situated 300 400 km above the earths surface . It is this which is often referred to as the Appleton Layer as is responsible for enabling most long range short wave telecommunication . The magneto-ionic theory also allowed Appleton to explain the origin of the mysterious fadings heard on the radio around sunset . During the day , the light from the sun causes the molecules in the air to become ionised even at fairly low altitudes . At these low altitudes , the density of the air is great and thus the electron density of ionised air is very large . Due to this heavy ionisation , there is strong absorption of electromagnetic waves caused by electron friction . Thus in transmissions over any distance , there will be no reflections as any waves apart from the one at ground level
