sugar level , glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid . The disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range . # Cancer # The small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology , particularly in imaging . Quantum dots ( nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , can produce exceptional images of tumor sites . These nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation . This means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today 's organic dyes used as contrast media . The downside , however , is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements . Another nanoproperty , high surface area to volume ratio , allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle , which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells . Additionally , the small size of nanoparticles ( 10 to 100 nanometers ) , allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites ( because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system ) . Research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect , image , and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way . A promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials .
