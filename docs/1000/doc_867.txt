wave , meaning they travel different distances from sender to receiver . Let the distance AC travelled by the ground wave be h and the distance ABC travelled by the reflected wave h . The path difference is : <math> h ' -h=D </math> The wavelength of the transmitted signal is . The number of wavelengths difference between the paths h and h is : <math> frach-h ' lambda=fracDlambda=N </math> If N is an integer number , then constructive interference will occur , this means a maximum signal will be achieved at the receiving end . If N is an odd integer number of half wavelengths , then destructive interference will occur and a minimum signal will be received . Let us assume we are receiving a maximum signal for a given wavelength . If we start to change , this is the process called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and destructive interference will start to occur , meaning the signal will start to fade . Now we keep changing until a maximum signal is once again received . The means that for our new value , our new value N is an also an integer number . If we have lengthened then we know that N is one less than N. Thus : <math> N-N ' =fracDlambda-fracDlambda ' =1 </math> Rearranging for D gives : <math> D=h-h ' **29;105634;TOOLONG ' </math> As we know and , we can calculate D. Using the approximation that ABC is an isosceles triangle , we can use our value of D to calculate the height of the reflecting layer . This method is a slightly simplified version of the method used by Appleton and his colleagues to work out a first value for the height of the
