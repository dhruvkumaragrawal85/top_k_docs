Pyke worked at Combined Operations Headquarters ( COHQ ) , alongside Bernal , and was regarded as a genius by Mountbatten . Pyke conceived the idea of Habbakuk while in the US organising the production of M29 Weasels for Project Plough , a scheme to assemble an elite unit for winter operations in Norway , Romania , and the Italian Alps . He had been considering the problem of how to protect seaborne landings and Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that steel and aluminium were in short supply and required for other purposes . Pyke realized that the answer was ice , which could be manufactured for only 1% of the energy needed to make an equivalent mass of steel . He proposed that an iceberg , natural or artificial , be levelled to provide a runway and hollowed out to shelter aircraft . From New York , Pyke sent the proposal he had composed on Habbakuk via diplomatic bag to COHQ with a label forbidding anyone apart from Mountbatten from opening the package . Mountbatten in turn passed Pyke 's proposal on to Churchill , who was enthusiastic about it . Pyke was not the first to suggest a floating mid-ocean stopping point for aircraft , nor even the first to suggest that such a floating island could be made of ice : German scientist Dr. Gerke von Waldenburg proposed the idea and carried out some preliminary experiments in Lake Zurich in 1930 .
