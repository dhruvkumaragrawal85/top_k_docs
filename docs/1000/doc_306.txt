</sup> Bk - ! <sup> 249 </sup> Cf # Hot fusion # Hot fusion reactions are processes that create compound nuclei at high excitation energy ( 4050 MeV , therefore hot ) , leading to a reduced probability of survival from fission . The excited nucleus then decays to the ground state via the emission of 35 neutrons . Fusion reactions utilizing <sup> 48 </sup> Ca nuclei usually produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are sometimes referred to as warm fusion reactions . This leads , in part , to relatively high yields from these reactions . ; <sup> 238 </sup> U ( <sup> 51 </sup> V , ' ' x ' ' n ) <sup> 289 ' ' x ' ' </sup> Uup There are strong indications that this reaction was performed in late 2004 as part of a uranium(IV) fluoride target test at the GSI . No reports have been published , suggesting that no product atoms were detected , as anticipated by the team . ; <sup> 243 </sup> Am ( <sup> 48 </sup> Ca , ' ' x ' ' n ) <sup> 291 ' ' x ' ' </sup> Uup ( x=2,3,4 ) This reaction was first performed by the team in Dubna in JulyAugust 2003 . In two separate runs , they were able to detect 3 atoms of <sup> 288 </sup> Uup and a single atom of <sup> 287 </sup> Uup . The reaction was studied further in June 2004 in an attempt to isolate the descendant <sup> 268 </sup> Db from the <sup> 288 </sup> Uup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 SF decays were measured with a lifetime consistent with <sup> 268 </sup> Db .
