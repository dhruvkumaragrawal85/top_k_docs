magazine was launched in the summer of that year by an editorial collective consisting of Alan Albon , Richard Hunt and Marcus Christo . Early issues featured a range of broadly anarchist and ecological ideas , bringing together groups and individuals as varied as Class War , veteran anarchist writer Colin Ward , anarcho-punk band Crass , as well as the Peace Convoy , anti-nuclear campaigners , animal rights activists and so on . However the diversity that many saw as the publication 's greatest strength quickly led to irreconcilable arguments between the essentially pacifist approach of Albon and Christo , and the advocacy of violent confrontation with the State favoured by Hunt . During the 1990s ' ' Green Anarchist ' ' came under the helm of an editorial collective that included Paul Rogers , Steve Booth and others , during which period the publication became increasingly aligned with primitivism , an anti-civilization philosophy advocated by writers such as John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 , Hampshire Police began a series of at least 56 raids , code named ' Operation Washington ' , that eventually resulted in the August to November 1997 Portsmouth trial of Green Anarchist editors Booth , Saxon Wood , Noel Molland and Paul Rogers , as well as Animal Liberation Front ( ALF ) Press Officer Robin Webb and Animal Liberation Front Supporters Group ( ALFSG ) newsletter editor Simon Russell . The defendants organised the GANDALF Defence campaign . Three of the editors of Green Anarchist , Noel Molland , Saxon Wood and Booth were jailed for ' conspiracy to incite ' . However , all three were shortly afterwards released on appeal . # Fredy Perlman # Fredy Perlman ( August 20 , 1934 July 26
