lethal rhabdomyosarcoma within a few weeks . Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and pyrophoric . On impact with a hard target , such as an armored vehicle , the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp . The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its pyrophoric properties . When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle it catches fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and possibly causing the vehicle to explode . DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120 mm or 105 mm cannons employed on the M1 Abrams tank . The Russian military has used DU ammunition in tank main gun ammunition since the late 1970s , mostly for the 115 mm guns in the T-62 tank and the 125 mm guns in the T-64 , T-72 , T-80 , and T-90 tanks . The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20 mm projectiles , 200 g in 25 mm ones , 280 g in 30 mm , 3.5 kg in 105 mm , and 4.5 kg in 120 mm penetrators . DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make hand grenades , cluster bombs , and land mines , but those applications have been discontinued , according to Alliant Techsystems . The US Navy used DU in its 20 mm Phalanx CIWS guns , but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten .
