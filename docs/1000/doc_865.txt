Across a series of six radio broadcasts , titled ' ' Science and the Nation ' ' , Appleton explored the many facets of scientific activity in Britain at the time . # Works # Appleton had observed that the strength of the radio signal from a transmitter on a frequency such as the medium wave band and over a path of a hundred miles or so was constant during the day but that it varied during the night . This led him to believe that it was
