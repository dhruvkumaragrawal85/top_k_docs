practiced law in Weinfelden was certainly the airship inventor Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin ( 1838-1917 ) . In Hberlins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1934 in which he writes that Count Zeppelin was among other things his client in manners such as border disputes with the eminent psychiatrist Ludwig Binswanger ( 1881-1966 ) who was running an exclusive psychiatric clinic nearby , the Sanatorium Bellevue . When Hberlin and the Count were discussing business matters in the lounge of the Counts family estate Schloss Girsberg , it was not rare that they heard the propeller noise of Count Zeppelins airship passing by . In moments like these , Count Zeppelins attention was drawn away from matters at hand and Hberlin suggested , Excellency , shall we take a break until the airship has passed ? , upon which Count Zeppelin stood up , went to the window with a smile , saying , Yes , you are right , Sir . In the rare moments of leisurely life , Hberlin found a lot of comfort in mountaineering and one day he took his wife to the beautiful Alpine village of Zermatt and when he was introducing her to the different peaks surrounding it , an American tourist standing nearby overheard his explanations and assumed Hberlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked politely if it was possible to have him - the President of the Federal Council of Switzerland - as a mountain guide . In his usual manner of being low-key , the president politely explained to the American that he was on a holiday with his wife to show her the natural wonders of the Swiss Alps and thus wasnt the mountain guide the gentlemen had mistaken him
