wear . The electrical arc slowly erodes the inner wall of the tube , forming microscopic cracks that give the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , increasing the pressure beyond an operable level . This causes triggering problems , known as jitter . However , at higher energy levels the lifetime can be calculated with a fair degree of accuracy . When operated below 30% of the explosion energy , flashtube lifetime is generally between a few million to tens of millions of flashes . # Applications # As the duration of the flash that is emitted by a xenon flashtube can be accurately controlled , and due to the high intensity of the light , xenon flashtubes are commonly used as photographic strobe lights . Xenon flashtubes are also used in very high speed or stop-motion photography , which was pioneered by Harold Edgerton in the 1930s . Because they can generate bright attention-getting flashes with a relatively small continuous input of electrical power , they are also used in aircraft warning lights , emergency vehicle lighting , fire alarm annunciator devices ( ' ' horn lights ' ' ) , aircraft anticollision beacons , and other similar applications . In dentistry it is used in so called Light Box device to light activate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials ( for example Megaflash mini , Uni XS and other devices ) Due to their high-intensity and relative brightness at short wavelengths ( extending into the ultraviolet ) and short pulse widths , flashtubes are also ideally suited as light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states where they can subsequently be stimulated to emit coherent monochromatic light .
