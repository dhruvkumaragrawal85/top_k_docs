. # Variants # The SU-122 had no variants that went into mass production . The T-34 chassis of the SU-122 was further adapted as part of the later SU-85 self-propelled gun . Towards the end of the production run , a prototype SU-122 was built with the same ball mantlet as the SU-85 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the SU-122 was being mass-produced , its design was being refined primarily with an eye to reduce production costs . The M-30S armament proved poorly suited for purpose , in spite of its prior recommendation by the GAU RKKA artillery committee . The howitzer took a lot of space and required both commander and gunner to operate it in order to fire . Because of this , in January 1943 work started on fitting the SU-122 with a different howitzer . The prototype SU-122M was built in April 1943 . It featured a bigger fighting compartment as well as an individual driver 's hatch . The M-30S howitzer , mounted on the floor of the vehicle , was replaced by the more modern D-11 howitzer ( a variant of U-11 howitzer ) . However , the SU-122M was not put into production due to a decision to proceed with the SU-85 instead . # SU-122-III # Another attempt to create an improved SU-122 replacement took a SU-85 chassis and paired it with the 122-mm D-6 howitzer , which was lighter and smaller than the U-11 howitzer . This was unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism and its poor anti-tank capabilities . Subsequent wartime design work on 122 mm self-propelled howitzers was cancelled . @@332514 otherlinks = Prince of Wales Hospital ( ) is a regional acute public hospital located
