Instead of merely using the MD- prefix as a marketing symbol , an application was made to again amend the Type Certificate to include the MD-81 , MD-82 , and MD-83 .

In addition to the Long Beach , California line , a second assembly line was set up at Shanghai , where aircraft were to be built under license . During 1991 , MD-80 production had reached a peak of 12 per
