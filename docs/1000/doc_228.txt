their families voiced concern about subsequent health problems . In 1999 , assessment of the first 1,000 veterans involved in the Ministry of Defence 's Gulf War medical assessment programme found no evidence of a single illness , physical or mental , that would explain the pattern of symptoms observed in the group . Nevertheless , in 1999 , MEDACT petitioned for the WHO to conduct an investigation into illnesses in veterans and Iraqi civilians . A major 2006 review of peer-reviewed literature by a US Institute of Medicine committee concluded that , because the symptoms vary greatly among individuals , they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their report conceded that the lack of objective pre-deployment health data meant definitive conclusions were effectively impossible . . The quote is of Lynn Goldman , who chaired the IOM committee that carried out the review . <p> notes that despite clear evidence of an increase in symptom burden and a decrease in well being among Gulf War veterans , exhaustive clinical and laboratory based scientific research has failed to document many reproducible biomedical abnormalities in this group . Likewise , there has been no evidence of an increase in disease related mortality . Simon Wessely praised the IOM 's review , and noted that despite its central conclusion that no novel syndrome existed , its other findings made it equally clear that service in the Gulf war did aversely affect health in some personnel . . The quote is of Wessely himself . Aside from the lack of baseline data to guide analysis of the veterans ' postwar health , because no detailed health screening was carried out when the veterans entered service , another major stumbling block with some studies , like the
