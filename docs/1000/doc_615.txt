1737 and 1884 ( both quakes estimated at about 5.5 magnitude ) , and the Charleston earthquake in South Carolina in 1886 ( estimated magnitude 6.5 to 7.3 ) . The Charleston quake was particularly surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had almost no history of even minor earthquakes . In 2001 , a large intraplate earthquake devastated the region of Gujarat , India . The earthquake occurred far from any plate boundaries , which meant the region above the epicenter was unprepared for earthquakes . In particular , the Kutch district suffered tremendous damage , where the death toll was over 12,000. # Causes # Many cities live with the seismic risk of a rare , large intraplate earthquake . The cause of these earthquakes is often uncertain . In many cases , the causative fault is deeply buried , and sometimes can not even be found . Under these circumstances it is difficult to calculate the exact seismic hazard for a given city , especially if there was only one earthquake in historical times . Some progress is being made in understanding the fault mechanics driving these earthquakes . # Prediction # Scientists continue to search for the causes of these earthquakes , and especially for some indication of how often they recur . The best success has come with detailed micro-seismic monitoring , involving dense arrays of seismometers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causative fault can be located with great accuracy , and in most cases these line up in patterns consistent with faulting . Cryoseisms can sometimes be mistaken for intraplate earthquakes . @@233514 Louisburg is the name of some places in the United States of America and Canada : *Louisbourg , Nova Scotia ,
