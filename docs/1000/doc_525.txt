The waters find their way , : Now laughing in the sun - now swallowed up : In caverns pervious to their course alone , : They leave their channel dry , and hide awhile : Their silent flow ; like bitter tears , unshed : From the dim eye , before a careless world : Unheeding of our grief ; but swelling still : In the full heart , which leaves unsoothed , unseen ,
