The use of a xenon flash lamp may be suitable for photographing or lightning projects . As with all ionized gases , xenon flashtubes emit light in various spectral lines . This is the same phenomenon that gives neon signs their characteristic color . However , neon signs emit red light because of extremely low current densities when compared to those seen in flashtubes , which favors spectral lines of longer wavelengths . Higher current densities tend to favor shorter wavelengths . The light from xenon , in a neon sign , likewise is rather violet . The spectrum emitted by flashtubes is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type . Low current densities produce spectral line emission , against a faint background of continuous radiation . Xenon has many spectral lines in the UV , blue , green , red , and IR portions of the spectrum . Low current densities produce a greenish-blue flash , indicating the absence of significant yellow or orange lines . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be directed into the invisible IR spectral lines around 820 , 900 , and 1000 nm . Low current densities for flashtubes are generally less than 1000 A/cm <sup> 2 </sup> . Higher current densities begin to produce continuum emission . Spectral lines are less dominant as light is produced across the spectrum , usually peaking , or centered , on a certain wavelength . Optimum output efficiency in the visual range is obtained at a density that favors greybody
