@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied directly to , or very near , the glass envelope . ( Water-cooled flashtubes sometimes apply this pulse directly to the cooling water , and often to the housing of the unit as well , so care must be taken with this type of system . ) The short , high voltage pulse creates a rising electrostatic field , which ionizes the gas inside the tube . The capacitance of the glass couples the trigger pulse into the envelope , where it exceeds the breakdown voltage of the gas surrounding one or both of the electrodes , forming spark streamers . The streamers propagate via capacitance along the glass at a speed of 1 centimeter in 60 nanoseconds ( 170 km/s ) . ( A trigger pulse must have a long enough duration to allow one streamer to reach the opposite electrode , or erratic triggering will result . ) The triggering can be enhanced by applying the trigger pulse to a reference plane , which may be in the form of a metal band or reflector affixed to the glass , a conductive paint , or a thin wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacitor voltage is greater than the voltage drop between the cathode and the anode , when the internal spark streamers bridge the electrodes the capacitor will discharge through the ionized gas , heating the xenon to a high enough temperature for the emission light . # Series triggering # Series triggering is more common in high powered , water-cooled flashtubes , such as those found in lasers . The high voltage leads of the trigger-transformer are connected to the flashtube in series , ( one lead to an electrode
