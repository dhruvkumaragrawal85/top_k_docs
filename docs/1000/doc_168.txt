Psychosurgery remained standard practice until the discovery of antipsychotic pharmacology in the 1950s . The first clinical trial of antipsychotics ( also commonly known as neuroleptics ) for the treatment of psychosis took place in 1952 . Chlorpromazine ( brand name : Thorazine ) passed clinical trials and became the first antipsychotic medication approved for the treatment of both acute and chronic psychosis . Although the mechanism of action was not discovered until 1963 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dopamine antagonist , or first generation antipsychotic . While clinical trials showed a high response rate for both acute psychosis and disorders with psychotic features , the side-effects were particularly harsh , which included high rates of often irreversible Parkinsonian symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia . With the advent of atypical antipsychotics ( also known as second generation antipsychotics ) came a dopamine antagonist with a comparable response rate but a far different , though still extensive , side-effect profile that included a lower risk of Parkinsonian symptoms but a higher risk of cardiovascular disease . Atypical antipsychotics remain the first-line treatment for psychosis associated with various psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , major depressive disorder , anxiety disorders , dementia , and some autism spectrum disorders . It is now known that dopamine is the primary neurotransmitter implicated in psychotic symptomology . Thus , blocking dopamine receptors ( namely , the dopamine D2 receptors ) and decreasing dopaminergic activity continues to be an effective but highly unrefined pharmacologic goal of antipsychotics . Recent pharmacological research suggests that the decrease in dopaminergic activity does not eradicate psychotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in the development of delusional thinking ; that is , connecting or finding meaningful
