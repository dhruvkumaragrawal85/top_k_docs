These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates , a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water , because the polar sulfonate ( of detergents ) is less likely than the polar carboxyl ( of soap ) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water . In most household contexts , the term ' ' detergent ' ' by itself refers specifically to ' ' laundry detergent ' ' or ' ' dish detergent ' ' , as opposed to ' ' hand soap ' ' or other types of cleaning agents . Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions . Detergents , like soaps , work because they are amphiphilic : partly hydrophilic ( polar ) and partly hydrophobic ( non-polar ) . Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds ( like oil and grease ) with water . Because air is not hydrophilic , detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees . # Chemical classification of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants. #
