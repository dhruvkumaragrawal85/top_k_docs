Frame 2 : Spark streamers connect and move away from the glass , as amperes surge . Frame 3 : Capacitor current begins to flow , heating the surrounding xenon . Frame 4 : As resistance decreases current fills the tube , heating the xenon to a plasma state . Frame 5 : Fully heated , the full current load rushes through the tube and the xenon emits a burst of light . @@390514 subdivisiontype1 = Voivodeship Ostrw Wielkopolski ( ) ( often abbreviated ' ' Ostrw Wlkp .
