@ @ @ @ the Mole # # Mole Gap # The North Downs Way crosses the river at Box Hill via seventeen hexagonal stepping stones , which are frequently submerged after heavy rainfall . The current stones were dedicated in September 1946 by the then Prime Minister Clement Attlee , replacing those destroyed during WW2 as an anti-invasion measure . The location is popular both with anglers and families , although swimming is strongly discouraged as the water is polluted in places . The stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of Westhumble . When the Burford Bridge was rebuilt in 1937 , excavations revealed a flint-surfaced approach to a ford at low level having all the signs of Roman workmanship suggesting that Stane Street ( which ran from London to Chichester via Dorking ) crossed the river at this point . In Defoe 's time , there was a footbridge at this point , but carts and waggons had to cross the river by a ford . # Leatherhead # There are three listed bridges in Leatherhead of which the 14 arch Leatherhead Town Bridge is the oldest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late Middle Ages and was rebuilt and enlarged by the county surveyor George Gwilt in 1782-83 . The bridge is a long structure of 14 segmental arches resting on low piers , finished in red brick in Flemish bond , with some Portland stone dressing . A few metres downstream of Leatherhead Bridge stands the Grade II listed railway viaduct which carries the Leatherhead to Dorking line over the river . The bridge was constructed in 1867 and , at the insistence of Thomas Grissell the landowner , was given lavish architectural treatment .
