Nicholas Wilcox Cundy proposed a Grand Imperial Ship Canal from Deptford to Chichester passing through the Mole Gap , however he was unable to attract sufficient financial interest in his scheme . Today the Mole is navigable for the 400 m from the confluence with the River Thames to Molember Weir at East Molesey where there is a private mooring facility . The river may be paddled all year by canoe between Brockham and Fetcham with an appropriate licence from the British Canoe Union . # World War II defences # During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mole were fortified for the defence of London against invasion from the south . GHQ Line B ran along the North Downs from Farnham and Guildford , crossing the Mole Gap to the north of Dorking and following the river to Horley . Between Betchworth and Box Hill , the north bank of the River Mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing . At Boxhill Farm , where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows , a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure . Gun mounts were also installed to protect both Boxhill and Deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were installed . An anti-tank ditch was dug from the Stepping Stones eastwards across the fields belonging to Bradley Farm ( now Denbies vineyard ) . The river crossing at Sidlow Bridge was heavily defended and a line of pill boxes was constructed on the north bank of the river . Concrete anti-tank dragon 's teeth were built on both sides of the river , a short distance upstream of the bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @
