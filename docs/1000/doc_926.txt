They were never told what they were building . Bernal informed COHQ that the Canadians were building a 1,000 ton model , and that it was expected to take 8 men 14 days to build it . The Chief of Combined Operations ( CCO ) responded that Churchill had invited the Chiefs of Staff Committee to arrange for an order to be placed for one complete ship at once with the highest priority , with further ships to be ordered immediately if it appeared the scheme was certain of success . The Canadians were confident about constructing a vessel for 1944 . The necessary materials were available to them in the form of 300,000 tons of wood pulp , 25,000 tons of fibreboard insulation , 35,000 tons of timber and 10,000 tons of steel . The cost was estimated at 700,000 . Meanwhile , Perutz had determined via his experiments at Smithfield Market that the optimum structural properties were given by a mixture of 14% wood pulp and 86% water . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if certain tests were not completed in May , there would be no chance of delivering a completed ship in 1944 . By May the problem of plastic flow had become serious and it was obvious that more steel reinforcement would be needed as well as a more effective insulating skin around the vessel 's hull . This caused the cost estimate to increase to 2.5 million . In addition , the Canadians had decided that it was impractical to attempt the project
