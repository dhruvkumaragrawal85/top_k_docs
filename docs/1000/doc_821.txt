power or continuous-wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp , and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well , so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit . Above 15 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> forced air cooling is required ; liquid cooling if in a confined space . Liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> . Thinner walls can survive higher average-power loads due to lower mechanical strain across the thickness of the material , which is caused by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. 1 mm thick doped quartz has limit of 160 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> , 0.5 mm thick one has limit of 320 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> ) . For this reason , thinner glass is often used for continuous-wave arc-lamps . Thicker materials can generally handle more impact energy from the shock wave that a short-pulsed arc can generate , so quartz as much as 1 mm thick is often used in the construction of flashtubes . The material of the envelope provides another limit for the output power ; 1 mm thick fused quartz has a limit of 200 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> , synthetic quartz of same thickness can run up to 240 W/cm <sup> 2 </sup> . Aging lamps require some derating , due to increased energy absorption in the glass due to solarization and sputtered deposits . # Electrodes and seals # The electrodes protrude into each end of the tube , and are sealed to the glass using a few different methods . Ribbon seals use thin strips of molybdenum foil bonded directly to the glass , which are very durable , but are @ @ @
