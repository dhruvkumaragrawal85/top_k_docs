Cacamatzin was a son of the previous king Nezahualpilli by one of his mistresses . Traditionally , the Texcocan kings were elected by the nobility from the most able of the royal family . Cacamatzin 's election to the throne in 1515 was said to have been made under considerable pressure from Moctezuma II , lord of Tenochtitln .

Cacamatzin was strangled by soldiers of Spanish conquistador Hernn Corts , who some sources say were torturing him in an effort to get gold . @@355514 birthplace = Dundrum , County Dublin , Ireland currentteam = Retired majorwins = Grand Tours : Tour de France : : General classification ( 1987 ) : : 3 individual stages : Giro d'Italia : : General classification ( 1987 ) : : 2 individual stages Stage races **6;0;br : ParisNice : : General classification ( 1981 ) : Tour de Romandie : : General classification ( 1983 , 1984 , 1987 ) : Tour of the Basque Country : : General classification ( 1989 ) One-day races and Classics **6;8;br : Super Prestige Pernod International ( 1987 ) : Critrium International (
