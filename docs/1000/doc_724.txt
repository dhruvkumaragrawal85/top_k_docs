Three of the women had their episiotomy repair done by an intern in June , and the forth woman was treated by a resident doctor in July . The problems were noticed when the women went for post-natal check-ups , and the gauze was removed . An investigation found that the intern was at fault for not checking the number of pieces of gauze involved . After the incidents , the hospital has strengthened the episiotomy repair guidelines , which require the doctor to count the number of pieces of gauze together with a nurse after the procedure , to ensure that no gauze is retained in the patient 's body . @@335514 Murphy 's may refer to : *Murphy 's Irish Stout *Murphy 's law *Murphy 's , California *Murphy 's sign *G .
