chapter develops the theory of measure ( see Borel measure ) . In the second chapter he defines the integral both geometrically and analytically . The next chapters expand the ' ' Comptes Rendus ' ' notes dealing with length , area and applicable surfaces . The final chapter deals mainly with Plateau 's problem . This dissertation is considered to be one of the finest ever written by a mathematician . His lectures from 1902 to 1903 were collected into a Borel tract ' ' Leons sur l'intgration et la recherche des fonctions primitives ' ' . The problem of integration regarded as the search for a primitive function is the keynote of the book . Lebesgue presents the problem of integration in its historical context , addressing Augustin-Louis Cauchy , Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable that the integral should satisfy , the last of which is If the sequence f <sub> n </sub> ( x ) increases to the limit f(x) , the integral of f <sub> n </sub> ( x ) tends to the integral of f(x) . Lebesgue shows that his conditions lead to the theory of measure and measurable functions and the analytical and geometrical definitions of the integral . He turned next to trigonometric functions with his 1903 paper Sur les sries trigonomtriques . He presented three major theorems in this work : that a trigonometrical series representing a bounded function is a Fourier series , that the n <sup> th </sup> Fourier coefficient tends to zero ( the RiemannLebesgue lemma ) , and that a Fourier series is integrable term by term . In 1904-1905 Lebesgue lectured once again at the Collge de France , this time on trigonometrical series and
