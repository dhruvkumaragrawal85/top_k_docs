nanotube scaffolds . Tissue engineering might replace today 's conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants . Advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension . Artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates. # Antimicrobial effects # Nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties . It has been shown that Zinc Oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vitro . Nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs . Another example is Silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds . Antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry. # Immune response # Buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy/immune response by preventing mast cells ( which cause allergic response ) from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues , by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti-oxidant currently available , such as vitamin E . In February 2013 , University of Pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response ; which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future . This is done by using the protein CD47 , found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the SIRPa in macrophages ; preventing an immune response from being triggered . # Arthroscope # Nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes , which are pencil-sized devices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do the surgeries with smaller incisions . The smaller the incisions the faster the healing
