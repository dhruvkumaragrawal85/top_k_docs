he went on to publish his lectures in another of the Borel tracts . In this tract he once again treats the subject in its historical context . He expounds on Fourier series , Cantor-Riemann theory , the Poisson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reprsentation trigonomtrique approche des fonctions satisfaisant a une condition de Lipschitz deals with the Fourier series of functions satisfying a Lipschitz condition , with an evaluation of the order of magnitude of the remainder term . He also proves that the RiemannLebesgue lemma is a best possible result for continuous functions , and gives some treatment to Lebesgue constants . Lebesgue once wrote , Rduites des thories gnrales , les mathmatiques seraient une belle forme sans contenu . ( Reduced to general theories , mathematics would be a beautiful form without content . ) In measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics , the LebesgueStieltjes integral generalizes RiemannStieltjes and Lebesgue integration , preserving the many advantages of the latter in a more general measure-theoretic framework . During the course of his career , Lebesgue also made forays into the realms of complex analysis and topology . He also had a disagreement with Borel ( called ' ' teilweise heftig ' ' ) with regards to effective calculation . However , these minor forays pale in comparison to his contributions to real analysis ; his contributions to this field had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his methods have become an essential part of modern analysis . Additionally , he is claimed to be the last of the mathematicians to consider one to be a prime number . # Lebesgue 's theory of integration # This is a non-technical treatment from a historical point of view
