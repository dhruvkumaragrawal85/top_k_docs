possible that two radio signals were being received . One was travelling along the ground , and another was reflected by a layer in the upper atmosphere . The fading or variation in strength of the overall radio signal received resulted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reflecting atmospheric layer was not in itself a completely new idea . Balfour Stewart had suggested the idea in the late nineteenth century to explain rhythmic changes in the earths magnetic field . More recently , in 1902 , Oliver Heaviside and A. E. Kennelly had suggested such a hypothesis may explain the success Marconi had in transmitting his signals across the Atlantic . Calculations had shown that natural bending of the radio waves was not sufficient to stop them from simply shooting off into empty space before they reached the receiver . Appleton thought the best place to look for evidence of the ionosphere was in the variations he believed it was causing around sunset in radio signal receptions . It was sensible to suggest these variations were due to the interference of two waves but an extra step to show that the second wave causing the interference ( the first being the ground wave ) was coming down from the ionosphere . The experiment he designed had two methods to show ionospheric influence and both allowed the height of the lower boundary of reflection ( thus the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first method was called frequency modulation and the second was to calculate the angle of arrival of the reflected signal at the receiving aerial . The frequency modulation method exploits the fact that there is a path difference between the ground wave and the reflected
