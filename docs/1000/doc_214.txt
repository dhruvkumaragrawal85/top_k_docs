contains about 0.71% U-235 , 99.28% U-238 , and about 0.0054% U-234 . In order to produce enriched uranium , the process of isotope separation removes a substantial portion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power , weapons , or other uses . The remainder , ' ' depleted uranium ' ' , contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235 . Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235 , enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kg of natural uranium , and leaves about 10.8 kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission ( NRC ) defines ' ' depleted uranium ' ' as uranium with a percentage of the <sup> 235 </sup> U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight ( see ) . The military specifications designate that the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense ( DoD ) contain less than 0.3% <sup> 235 </sup> U ( AEPI , 1995 ) . In actuality , DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% <sup> 235 </sup> U ( AEPI , 1995 ) . Depleted Uranium is also produced by recycling ' spent ' nuclear fuel , in which case it contains traces of Pu and Np and has therefore been called ' dirty DU ' although the quantities are so small that they are considered to be not of serious radiological significance ( even ) by ECRR. # Uranium hexafluoride # Some depleted uranium produced is stored as uranium hexafluoride , a crystalline solid , ( D ) UF <sub> 6 </sub> , in steel cylinders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each cylinder holds up to 12.7
