will be absorbed rather than reflected . However , when the sun sets , the molecules slowly start to recombine with their electrons and the free electron density levels drop . This means absorption rates diminish and waves can be reflected with sufficient strengths to be noticed , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interference patterns to occur though , there must not simply be the presence of a reflected wave but a change in the reflected wave . Otherwise the interference is constant and fadings would not be heard . The received signal would simply be louder or softer than during the day . This suggests the height at which reflection happens must slowly change as the sun sets . Appleton found in fact that it increased as the sun set and then decreased as the sun rose until the reflected wave was too weak to record . This variation is compatible with the theory that ionisation is due to the suns influence . At sunset , the intensity of the suns radiation will be much less at the surface of the earth than it is high up in the atmosphere . This means ionic recombination will progress slowly from lower altitudes to higher ones and therefore the height at which waves are reflected slowly increases as the sun sets . The basic idea behind Appletons work is so simple that it is hard to understand at first how he devoted almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last couple of paragraphs some of the complexities of the subject have been introduced . Like many other fields , it is one that grows in intricacy the more it is studied . By the end of his life
