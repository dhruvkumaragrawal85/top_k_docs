similar to that on the DC-9 from which it evolved . Later models could be equipped to a higher specification with EFIS displays in place of the traditional analogue instruments , TCAS , windshear detection , etc . An EFIS retrofit to non-EFIS equipped aircraft is possible . Cabin : Typical passenger cabin seating arrangements include : : A mixed-class , with aft full-service galley , configuration for a total of 135 passengers with 12 first class , four-abreast 36-inch seat pitch . : 123 economy-class passengers , five-abreast , 32 in pitch . : All-economy layout for 155 passengers , five-abreast , 32- and 33-inch pitch . : A typical high-density layout is for 167 one class ( i.e. , Airtours ) .

The MD-80T , developed for the Chinese , differs in that the main units are each fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loading . Aerodynamic Improvements : From mid-1987 , new MD-87-style low-drag beaver tail cones were introduced on all Series of MD-80s , reducing drag and hence improving fuel burn . It would seem that some operators have been modifying the old DC-9-style cones on earlier-build MD-80s to the new low-drag style . SAS is one airline that has done this , citing both the improved economics as well as cosmetic improvement for the modification . # #MD-81 timeline# # * Formal launch : October 1977. * First flight : October 18 , 1979. * FAA certification : August 25 , 1980. * First delivery : September 13 , 1980 to Swissair * Entry into service : October 10 ,
