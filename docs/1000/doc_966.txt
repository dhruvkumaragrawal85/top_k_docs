in ornate boxes . From about the fifteenth century , when the coins were no longer in circulation , the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats . One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavored marzipan , named ( at least proximately ) after the box in which it was stored . However , if marzipan has its origin in Persia , it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban ( in Persian : , derived from the words Marz meaning border or boundary and the suffix -bn meaning guardian ) , a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia ( Iran ) between 3rd and 7th centuries CE . It is also a possibility that the origin of this dessert and the origin of the term come from different geographical places . # Production # To produce marzipan , raw almonds are cleaned by sieving , air elutriation , and other electronic or mechanical devices , then immersed in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . This loosens the almond 's skin , which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders . They are then cooled , after which they are coarsely chopped and ground , with up to 35% sugar , into almond flour . The almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled , after which sucrose ( table sugar ) and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added . It may then be molded into any shape . @@456514 Joe Melson ( born May 1935 ) is an American singer and a BMI Awardwinning songwriter. # Life
