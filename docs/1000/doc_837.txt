by excessively long pulse durations or high average power levels . When the inner wall of the tube gets too hot while the outer wall is still cold , this temperature gradient can cause the lamp to crack . Similarly , if the electrodes heat much faster than the glass , the lamp may crack or even shatter at the ends . # Gradual failure # The closer a flashtube operates to its explosion energy , the greater the risk becomes for catastrophic failure . At 50% of the explosion energy , the lamp may produce several thousand flashes before exploding . At 60% of the explosion energy , the lamp will usually fail in less than a hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy the risk of catastrophic failure becomes very low . The methods of failure then become those that reduce the output efficiency and affect the ability to trigger the lamp . The processes affecting these are sputter and ablation of the inner wall . Sputter occurs when the energy level is very low , below 15% of the explosion energy , or when the pulse duration is very long . Sputter is the vaporization of metal from the cathode , which is redeposited on the walls of the lamp , blocking the light output . Since the cathode is more emissive than the anode , the flashtube is polarized , and connecting the lamp to the power source incorrectly will quickly ruin it . However , even if connected properly , the degree of sputter may vary considerably from lamp to lamp . Therefore , it is impossible to predict the lifetime accurately at low energy levels . At higher energy levels , wall ablation becomes the main process of
