gas is crucial here , so the maximum of radiated output energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the lasing medium ; e.g. krypton flashtubes are more suitable than xenon flashtubes for pumping Nd:YAG lasers , as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of Nd:YAG . Xenon flashtubes have been used to produce an intense flash of white light , some of which is absorbed by Nd:glass that produces the laser power for inertial confinement fusion . In total about 1 to 1.5% of the electrical power fed into the flashtubes is turned into useful laser light for this application . # History # The flashtube was invented by Harold Edgerton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving objects . Flashtubes were mainly used for strobe lights in scientific studies , but eventually began to take the place of chemical and powder flash lamps in mainstream photography . Early high-speed photographs were taken with an open-air electrical arc discharge , called spark photography . The earliest known use of spark photography began with Henry Fox Talbot around 1850 . In 1886 , Ernst Mach used an open air spark to photograph a speeding bullet , revealing the shockwaves it produced at supersonic speeds . Open air spark systems were fairly easy to build , but were bulky , very limited in light output , and produced loud noises comparable to that of a gunshot . In 1927 , Harold Edgerton built his first flash unit while at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Wanting to photograph the motion of a motor in vivid detail , without blur , Edgerton decided to improve the process of spark photography by using a mercury-arc rectifier instead of an
