, so that the aphelion had to be within the orbit of Jupiter . Encke predicted its return for 1822 , but this return was observable only from the southern hemisphere and was seen by Carl Ludwig Christian Rmker in Australia . The comet was also identified with the one seen by Pierre Mchain in 1786 and by Caroline Herschel in 1795 . Encke sent his calculations as a note to Gauss , Olbers , and Bessel . His former mathematics professor published this note and Encke became famous as the discoverer of the short periodic comets . The first object of this family , the Encke comet , was named after him and so it is one of the few comets not named after the discoverer , but after the one who calculated the orbit . Later this comet was identified as the origin of the Taurids meteor showers . The importance of the predicted return based on the calculation by Encke was rewarded by the Royal Astronomical Society in London by presenting their Gold Medal to him in 1824 .

In 1825 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society . Eight masterly treatises on the comet 's movements were published by him in the ' ' Berliner Abhandlungen ' ' ( 18291859 ) . From a fresh discussion of the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 he deduced a solar parallax of 8.57 arcsecond . This and the corresponding distance to the sun were long accepted as authoritative . His results were published in two separate
