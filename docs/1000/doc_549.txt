He heard two of them , Uncle Wallace and Aunt Minerva Willis , singing religious songs that they had apparently composed . Among these were Swing Low , Sweet Chariot , Steal Away to Jesus , The Angels are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan , Roll .

He and his wife transcribed the songs of the Willises as they remembered them and sent them to Fisk University . The Jubilee Singers put on their first performance singing the old captives ' songs at a religious conference in 1871 .
