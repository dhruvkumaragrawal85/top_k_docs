sample of pure depleted uranium will generate small amounts of thorium-234 and protactinium-234 , which emit the more penetrating beta particles at almost the same rate as the uranium emits alpha rays . This is because uranium-238 decays directly to thorium-234 , which with a half-life of 24 days decays to protactinium-234 , which in turn decays in a matter of hours to the long-lived uranium-234 . A quasi-steady state is therefore reached within a few multiples of 24 days . Available evidence suggests that the radiation risk is small relative to the chemical hazard . Surveying the veteran-related evidence pertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' BMJ ' ' concluded it was not possible to justify claims of radiation-induced lung cancer and leukaemia in veterans of that conflict . While agreeing with the editorial 's conclusion , a reply noted that its finding in the negative was guaranteed , given that global dose estimates or results of mathematical modelling are too inaccurate to be used as dose values for an individual veteran , and that , as of April 2001 , no practical method of measuring the expected small doses that each individual veteran would receive had been suggested . . Mould 's suggestion was electron paramagnetic resonance dosimetry using tooth enamel . He also wrote that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology was able , using this method , to measure doses as low as 20 mSv , and that , if it were asked to , the NIST would be able to get involved , meaning at least one centre could help undertake a screening programme for veterans . The author of the reply , a radiation scientist , went on to suggest a method that had been used
