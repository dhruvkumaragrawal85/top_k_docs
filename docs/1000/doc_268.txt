protection was forfeit if used as cover for any belligerent action . This forfeiture is expressed in article 7 of the 1906 version of the Convention , which was the version in force at the time . The German authorities instead justified prosecution merely on the basis of the German law and the interests of the German state . The British government could do nothing to help her . Sir Horace Rowland of the Foreign Office said , I am afraid that it is likely to go hard with Miss Cavell ; I am afraid we are powerless . Lord Robert Cecil , Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs , said , Any representation by us , he advised , will do her more harm than good . The United States , however , had not yet joined the war and was in a position to apply diplomatic pressure . Hugh S. Gibson , First Secretary of the U.S. legation at Brussels , made clear to the German government that executing Cavell would further harm Germany 's already damaged reputation . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ von der Lancken of the burning of Leuven Baron von der Lancken is known to have stated that Cavell should be pardoned because of her complete honesty and because she had helped save so many lives , German as well as Allied . However , Traugott von Sauberzweig Cavell was not arrested for espionage , as many were led to believe , but for treason . When in custody , Cavell was questioned in French , but the session was minuted in German . This gave the interrogator the opportunity to misinterpret her answers . Although she may have been misrepresented , she made no attempt to defend herself .
