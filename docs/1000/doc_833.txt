wear and the need to adjust the pressure for each flash . Some research has been done on mixing gases to alter the spectral output . The effect on the output spectrum is negligible , but the effect on efficiency is great . Adding a lighter gas will only reduce the efficiency of the heavier one . # Light production # As the current pulse travels through the tube , it ionizes the atoms , causing them to jump to higher energy levels . Three types of particles are found within the arc plasma , consisting of electrons , positively ionized atoms , and neutral atoms . At any given time , the ionized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce all of the emitted light . As they recombine with their lost electrons they immediately drop back to a lower energy state , releasing photons in the process . The methods of transferring energy occur in three separate ways , called bound-bound , free-bound , and free-free transitions . Within the plasma , positive ions move toward the cathode while electrons and neutral atoms move toward the anode . Bound-bound transitions occur when the ions and neutral atoms collide , transferring an electron from the atom to the ion . This method predominates at low current densities , and is responsible for producing the spectral line emission . Free-bound transitions happen when an ion captures a free electron . This method produces the continuum emission , and is more prominent at higher current densities . Some of the continuum is also produced when an electron accelerates toward an ion , called free-free transitions , producing bremsstrahlung radiation . # Intensity and duration of flash # The only real electrical limit to how short a pulse
