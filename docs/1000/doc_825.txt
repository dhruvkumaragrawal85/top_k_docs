and the other to the capacitor ) . The trigger pulse forms a spark inside the lamp , without exposing the trigger voltage to the outside of the lamp . The advantages are better insulation , more reliable triggering , and an arc that tends to develop well away from the glass , but at a much higher cost . The series triggering transformer also acts as an inductor . This helps to control the flash duration , but prevents the circuit from being used in very fast discharge applications . The triggering can generally take place with a lower voltage at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trigger-transfromer becomes part of the flash circuit , and couples the triggering circuit to the flash energy . Therefore , because the trigger-transformer has very low impedance , the transformer , triggering circuit , and silicon controlled rectifier ( SCR ) must be able to handle very high peak currents , often in excess of 1500 amps. # Simmer voltage triggering # Simmer voltage triggering is the least common method . In this technique , the capacitor voltage is not initially applied to the electrodes , but instead , a high voltage spark streamer is maintained between the electrodes . The high current from the capacitor is delivered to the electrodes using a thyristor or a spark gap . This type of triggering is used mainly in very fast rise time systems , typically those that discharge in the microsecond regime , such as used in high speed stop-motion photography or dye lasers . The simmering spark streamer causes the arc to develop in the exact center of the lamp , increasing the lifetime dramatically . If external triggering is used , the spark streamers may
