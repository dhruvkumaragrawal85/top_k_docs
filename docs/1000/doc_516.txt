poem ' ' Poly-Olbion ' ' published in 1613 . In John Speed 's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend The river runneth under .

In John Rocque 's 1768 map of Surrey , the name ' ' Moulsey River ' ' is used . # Archaeology # In common with much of the rest of the Weald , the earliest evidence of human settlement along the Upper Mole is from the Mesolithic Period ( 20 000 - 7000 BC ) . Mesolithic sites at Wonham , Flanchford and Sidlow . Finds at Wonham include arrowheads and a plano-convex knife . The Lower Mole appears to have been settled during the same period and a flint axe dating from Mesolithic period found on spit of land close to River Mole in Cobham in 1965 . Remains of a flat-bottomed dug-out canoe were found at the confluence of the Mole and Thames in 1877 by a local boatman . The canoe is preserved at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford . The Mole Gap and North Downs do not appear to have been settled until the late Stone Age : A large axe , typical of a rough-out axe produced during the Neolithic period , which was discovered in 1952 during building work in Westhumble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
