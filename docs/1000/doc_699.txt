Several examples are given of persons accidentally being run over , or cars that turned into runaways because the driver operating the vehicle at the time of the accident was not familiar with its shift pattern and would shift into reverse when intending to shift to park . Nader makes an appeal to the auto industry to standardize gearshift patterns between makes and models as a safety issue . Early automatic transmissions , including GM 's Hydra-Matic , Packard 's Ultramatic , and Borg Warner 's automatic used by a number of independent manufacturers ( Rambler , Studebaker ) used a pattern of P N D L R , which put Reverse at the bottom of the quadrant , next to Low which was contrary to the pattern used by other manufacturers . Drivers used to moving the shift lever all the way down for low gear would accidentally select R and would unexpectedly move the car backwards . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push-button selector to choose gear ranges . Ford was the first to use the P R N D L pattern , which separated Reverse from forward ranges by Neutral . Eventually this pattern became the standard for all automatic-shift cars . Chevrolet 's Powerglide , at least as seen on the Corvair , used a R N D L pattern , which separated the Reverse from the Drive gears by neutral in the ideal way , but which had no P selection , relying instead on the process used with a manual transmission of the driver selecting N ( neutral ) and using a separate parking brake when parking . Chapter 2 also exposes problems in workmanship and the failure of companies to honor warranties.
