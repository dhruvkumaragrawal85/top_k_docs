increase the efficiency of other lasers with longer fluorescence lifetimes ( allowing longer pulses ) , such as Nd:YAG or titanium sapphire , by creating pulses with almost square waveforms . # Ablative flashtubes # Ablative flashtubes are triggered by under-pressurizing . Ablative flashtubes are typically constructed using quartz tubing and one or both electrodes hollowed out , allowing a vacuum pump to be attached to control the gas pressure . The electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capacitor , and then the gas is vacuumed from the lamp . When the gas reaches a low enough pressure ( often just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low pressures , the efficiency of the flash would normally be very low . However , because of the low pressure , the particles have room to accelerate to very high speeds , and the magnetic forces expand the arc so that the bulk of its pasma becomes concentrated at the surface , bombarding the glass . The bombardment ablates ( vaporizes ) large amounts of quartz from the inner wall . This ablation creates a sudden , violent increase in the internal pressure of the lamp , increasing the efficiency of the flash to very high levels . The ablation , however , causes extensive wear to the lamp , weakening the glass , and they typically need replacement after a very short lifetime . Ablative flashtubes need to be refilled and vacuumed to the proper pressure for each flash . Therefore , they can not be used for very high-repetition applications . Also , this usually precludes the use of very expensive gases like krypton or xenon . The most common gas used in an ablative flashtube is air , although sometimes cheap
