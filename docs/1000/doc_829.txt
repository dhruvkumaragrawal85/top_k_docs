, depending on pressure , shape , dead volume , current density , time , and flash duration , and therefore , is usually referred to as impedance . The most common symbol used for lamp impedance is K <sub> o </sub> , which is expressed as ohms ( amps <sup> 0.5 </sup> ) . K <sub> o </sub> is determined by the internal diameter , arc length , and gas type of the lamp and , to a lesser extent , by fill pressure . The resistance in flashtubes is not constant , but quickly drops as current density increases . In 1965 , Goncz showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square root of current density . As the arc develops , the lamp experiences a period of negative resistance , causing the resistance to decrease as the current increases . This occurs until the plasma comes into contact with the inner wall . When this happens , the voltage becomes proportional to the square root of current , and the resistance in the plasma becomes stable for the remainder of the flash . It is this value which is defined as K <sub> o </sub> . However , as the arc develops the gas expands , and calculations for K <sub> o </sub> do not take into account the dead volume , which leads to a lower pressure increase . Therefore , any calculation of K <sub> o </sub> is merely an approximation of lamp impedance. # Output spectrum # # Xenon # A xenon flash lamp is a gas-discharge lamp that contains xenon gas . These lamps have three leads : an anode , a cathode , and a trigger-voltage lead . When a certain voltage is applied to the trigger
