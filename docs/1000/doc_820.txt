In some applications , the emission of ultraviolet light is undesired , whether due to production of ozone , damage to laser rods , degradation of plastics , or other detrimental effects . In these cases , a doped fused silica is used . Doping with titanium dioxide can provide different cutoff wavelengths on the ultraviolet side , but the material suffers from solarization ; it is often used in medical and sun-ray lamps and some non-laser lamps . A better alternative is a cerium-doped quartz ; it does not suffer from solarization and has higher efficiency , as part of the absorbed ultraviolet is reradiated as visible via fluorescence . Its cutoff is at about 380 nm . Conversely , when ultraviolet is called for , a synthetic quartz is used as the envelope ; it is the most expensive of the materials , but it is not susceptible to solarization and its cutoff is at 160 nm . The power level of the lamps is rated in watts/area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cooling of the electrodes and the lamp envelope is of high importance at high power levels . Air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels . High power lamps are cooled with a liquid , typically by flowing demineralized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased . Water-cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes , to provide a direct thermal conductor between them and the cooling water . The cooling medium should flow also across the entire length of the lamp and electrodes . High average
