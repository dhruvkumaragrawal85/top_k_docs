attacking tanks ; sometimes this distance was shortened to between 200 m and 300 m . The use of SU-76 tank destroyers together with SU-122s proved unsuccessful . Based on combat experience , the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was changed ; the new regimental organization consisted of two batteries of SU-76 tank destroyers and three of SU-122s , for a total of 20 SPGs . In April the organization of self-propelled artillery regiments was again changed . Separate regiments were created for SU-76 tank destroyers ( light self-propelled artillery regiment ) and SU-122s ( medium self-propelled artillery regiment ) . The medium self-propelled artillery regiment consisted of four batteries of four SU-122s each . Each regiment was also equipped with either an additional SU-122 or a T-34 for the commander and a BA-64 armoured car . This organization remained in place until the beginning of 1944 when the SU-122 started to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and SU-85 tank destroyers . The SU-122 proved effective in its intended role of direct fire on strongholds . The massive concussion of the 122mm HE round was reportedly enough to blow the turret off even a Tiger I if a direct hit was scored at close range , although longer range penetration against heavier German armor remained poor , a trait shared with the larger 152mm howitzers . The new BP-460A HEAT projectile was introduced in May 1943 ; however its primitive warhead design was only minimally more effective than brute concussive effects of the old HE shell at close range . At least one SU-122 was captured by the German Army . A small number of SU-122s survived the war . Currently , only one example remains , on display in the Kubinka Tank Museum
