, ionospheric observatories had been set up all over the world to provide a global map of the reflecting layers . Links were found to the 11 year sunspot cycle and the Aurora Borealis , the magnetic storms that occur in high latitudes . This became particularly relevant during the second world war when the storms would lead to radio blackouts . Thanks to Appletons research , the periods when these would occur could be predicted and communication could be switched to wavelengths that would be least affected . RADAR , another crucial wartime innovation , was one that came about thanks to Appletons work . On a very general level , his research consisted in determining the distance of reflecting objects from radio signal transmitters . This is exactly the idea of RADAR and the flashing dots that appear on the screen ( a cathode ray tube ) scanned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Appleton as a new method , called the pulse method , to make ionospheric measurements . It was later adapted by Robert Watson-Watt to detect aeroplanes . Nowadays , ionospheric data is important when communications with satellites are considered . The correct frequencies for these signals must be selected so that they actually reach the satellites without being reflected or deviated before . In 1974 the Radio and Space Research Station was renamed the Appleton Laboratory in honour of the man who had done so much to establish the UK as a leading force in ionospheric research , and had been involved with the station first as a researcher and then as secretary of its parent body , the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research . # Honours and awards # Appleton was awarded the following : *
