not all of them . For functions on the real line , the Henstock integral is an even more general notion of integral ( based on Riemann 's theory rather than Lebesgue 's ) that subsumes both Lebesgue integration and improper Riemann integration . However , the Henstock integral depends on specific ordering features of the real line and so does not generalise to allow integration in more general spaces ( say , manifolds ) , while the Lebesgue integral extends to such spaces quite naturally . @@53514 Edith Louisa Cavell ( ; 4 December 1865 12 October 1915 ) was a British nurse .
