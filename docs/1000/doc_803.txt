normal matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized . In the infinite dimensional setting , not every bounded operator on a Banach space has an invariant subspace . However , the upper-triangularization of an arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operator on a complex Banach space has a nest of closed invariant subspaces. # Computation # Schur decomposition of a given matrix is known to be numerically computed by QR algorithm or its variants . In other words , the roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix are not necessarily computed ahead in order to obtain its Schur decomposition . Conversely , QR algorithm can be used to compute the roots of any given characteristic polynomial by finding the Schur decomposition of its companion matrix . Similarly , QR algorithm is used to compute the eigenvalues of any given matrix , which are the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix of the Schur decomposition . See the Nonsymmetric Eigenproblems section in LAPACK Users ' Guide . # Applications # Lie theory applications include : * Every invertible operator is contained in a Borel group . * Every operator fixes a point of the flag manifold . # Generalized Schur decomposition # Given square matrices ' ' A ' ' and ' ' B ' ' , the generalized Schur decomposition factorizes both matrices as <math> A=QSZ* </math> and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' ' Z ' ' are unitary , and ' ' S ' ' and ' ' T ' ' are upper triangular . The generalized Schur decomposition is also sometimes called the QZ decomposition .
