still be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the tube , causing wall ablation , or in extreme cases , cracking or even explosion of the lamp . However , because very short pulses often call for very high voltage and low capacitance , keeping the current density from rising too high , some microsecond flashtubes are triggered by simply over-volting , that is , by applying a voltage to the electrodes which is much higher than the lamp 's self-flash threshold , using a spark gap . Often , a combination of simmer voltage and over-volting is used . # Prepulse techniques # Very rapid rise-times are often achieved using a prepulse technique . This method is performed by delivering a small flash through the lamp just before the main flash . This flash is of much lower energy than the main flash ( typically less than 10% ) and , depending on the pulse duration , is delivered just a few thousandths to a few millionths of a second before the main flash . The prepulse heats the gas , leaving a good quantity of ionized particles to be used by the main flash . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave and makes less noise during operation , vastly increasing the lifetime of the lamp . It is especially effective on very fast discharge applications , allowing the arc to expand faster and better fill the tube . It is very often used with simmer voltage and sometimes with series triggering , but rarely used with external triggering . Prepulse techniques are most commonly used in the pumping of dye lasers , greatly increasing the conversion efficiency . However , it has also been shown to
