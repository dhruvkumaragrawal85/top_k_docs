have somewhat expanded to lower-altitude grassy plains . Within their mountainous environment , tamaraws will usually be found not far from sources of water . # Trophic ecology # The tamaraw is a grazer that feeds on grasses and young bamboo shoots although it is known to prefer cogon and ' ' talahib ' ' ( ' ' Saccharum spontaneum ' ' ) . They are naturally diurnal , feeding during the daytime hours ; however , daytime human activities have recently forced select ' ' B. mindorensis ' ' individuals to be nocturnal to avoid human contact . # Life history # The tamaraw is known to live for about 20 years , with an estimated lifespan of about 25 .
