weld together . This could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant . The flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly . # Visualization # Tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized . It is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body , so scientists used to dye the cells . These dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up . While different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light , there was a need for as many light sources as cells . A way around this problem is with luminescent tags . These tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes . The dots can be random in size , can be made of bio-inert material , and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size-dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce . Then both groups can be lit with a single light source . They have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble . # Tissue engineering # Nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue . Tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial-based scaffolds and growth factors . For example , bones could be regrown on carbon
