and the curve of a function defined for that axis . His theory was published originally in his dissertation ' ' Intgrale , longueur , aire ' ' ( Integral , length , area ) at the University of Nancy during 1902. # Personal life # Henri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in Beauvais , Oise . Lebesgue 's father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher . His parents assembled at home a library that the young Henri was able to use . Unfortunately his father died of tuberculosis when Lebesgue was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself . As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school , one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lyce Louis-le-Grand in Paris . In 1894 Lebesgue was accepted at the cole Normale Suprieure , where he continued to focus his energy on the study of mathematics , graduating in 1897 . After graduation he remained at the cole Normale Suprieure for two years , working in the library , where he became aware of the research on discontinuity done at that time by Ren-Louis Baire , a recent graduate of the school . At the same time he started his graduate studies at the Sorbonne , where he learned about mile Borel 's work on the incipient measure theory and Camille Jordan 's work on the Jordan measure . In 1899 he moved to a teaching position at the Lyce Central in Nancy , while continuing work on his doctorate . In 1902 he earned his Ph.D . from the Sorbonne with the seminal thesis on Integral , Length , Area ,
