book accusing car manufacturers of resistance to the introduction of safety features , like seat belts , and their general reluctance to spend money on improving safety . It was a pioneering work , openly polemical but containing substantial references and material from industry insiders . It made Nader a household name . # Theme # ' ' Unsafe at Any Speed ' ' is often characterized as the book about the Corvair , though only one of the book 's eight chapters covers the Corvair . The theme of tire pressures chosen for comfort rather than safety is recurrent , and the main theme throughout is the charge that the automobile industry evaded well-founded and technically informed criticism . # Organization and content # Each of the book 's chapters covers a different aspect of automotive safety : # The Sporty Corvair # The subject for which the book is probably most widely known , the rear-engined Chevrolet Corvair , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This relates to the first ( 19601964 ) models that had a swing-axle suspension design which was prone to tuck under in certain circumstances . In substitution for the cost-cutting lack of a front stabilizer bar ( anti-roll bar ) , Corvairs required tire pressures which were outside of the tire manufacturer 's recommended tolerances . The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential ( 15psi front , 26psi rear , when cold ; 18 psi and 30psi hot ) , and if one inflated the tires equally , as was standard practice for all other cars at the time , the result was a dangerous oversteer . Despite the fact that proper tire pressures was more critical than for contemporaneous designs , this
