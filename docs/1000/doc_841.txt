in a capacitor can remain surprisingly long after power has been disconnected . A flashtube will usually shut down before the capacitor has fully drained , and it may regain part of its charge through a process called dielectric absorption . In addition , the charging system itself can be equally deadly . The trigger voltage can deliver a painful shock , usually not enough to kill , but which can often startle a person into bumping or touching something more dangerous . When a person is charged to high voltages a spark can jump , delivering the high capacitor current without actually touching anything . Flashtubes operate at high pressures and are known to explode , producing violent shockwaves . The explosion energy of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just a few flashes ) is well defined , and to avoid catastrophic failure , it is recommended that no more than 30% of the explosion energy be used . Flashtubes should be shielded behind glass or in a reflector cavity . If not , eye and ear protection should be worn . Flashtubes produce very intense flashes , often faster than the eye can register , and may not appear as bright as they are . Quartz glass will transmit nearly all of the long and short wave UV , including the germicidal wavelengths , and can be a serious hazard to eyes and skin . This ultraviolet radiation can also produce large amounts of ozone , which can be harmful to people , animals , and equipment . Many compact cameras charge the flash capacitor immediately after power-up , and some even just by inserting the batteries . Merely inserting the battery into the camera can prime the capacitor to become
