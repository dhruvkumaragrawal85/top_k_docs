this coming season , and Bernal and Pyke were forced to conclude that no Habbakuk vessel would be ready in 1944 . Pyke was excluded from the planning for Habbakuk in an effort to secure American participation , a decision which Bernal supported . Pyke 's earlier disagreements with American personnel on Project Plough , which ultimately caused his removal from that project , were the main factor in this decision . In the early summer of 1943 , naval architects and engineers continued to work on Habbakuk with Bernal and Perutz . The requirements for the vessel became more demanding : it had to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest waves recorded , while the Admiralty wanted it to be torpedo-proof , which meant that the hull had to be at least 40ft m thick . The Fleet Air Arm decided that heavy bombers should be able to take off from it , which meant that the deck had to be 2000ft m long . Steering also raised problems ; it was initially projected that the ship be steered by varying the speed of the motors on either side , but the Royal Navy decided that a rudder was essential . However , the problem of mounting and controlling a rudder over 100ft m high was never solved . # Variants # Naval architects had produced three alternative versions of Pyke 's original concept , which were discussed at a meeting with the Chiefs of Staff in August 1943 : * ' ' Habbakuk I ' ' ( soon discarded ) would have been made of wood . * ' ' Habbakuk II ' ' was closest to the COHQ model and would be a very large , slow , self-propelled vessel
