Moreover , the absolute uranium concentrations indicate that there was no contamination of the earthworm species studied . # Contamination as a result of the Afghan War # The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in Jalalabad that showed concentrations of 80400 ng/L of undepleted uranium , far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of 5 ng/L. # Studies indicating negligible effects # Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects . A 1999 literature review conducted by the Rand Corporation stated : No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium , whether inhaled or ingested , even at very high doses , and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific . A 2001 oncology study concluded that the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give rise to cancer induction . Former NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson stated in 2001 that the existing medical consensus is clear . The hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited , and limited to very specific circumstances . A 2002 study from the Australian defense ministry concluded that there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries .. studies of Gulf War veterans show that
