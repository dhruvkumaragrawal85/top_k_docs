ionosphere in 1924 . In their experiment , they used the BBC broadcasting station in Bournemouth to vary the wavelengths of its emissions after the evening programmes had finished . They installed a receiving station in Oxford to monitor the interference effects . The receiving station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emitter at the right distance of about 100 km from Cambridge in those days . This frequency modulation method revealed that the point from which waves were being reflected was approximately 90 km . However , it did not establish that the waves were reflected from above , indeed they may have been coming from hills somewhere between Oxford and Bournemouth . The second method , which involved finding the angle of incidence of the reflected waves at the receiver , showed for sure that they were coming from above . Triangulations from this angle gave results for the height of reflection compatible with the frequency modulation method . We will not go into this method in detail because it involves fairly complex calculations using Maxwells electromagnetic theory . Far from being conclusive , the success of the Oxford-Bournemouth experiment revealed a vast new field of study to be explored . It showed that there was indeed a reflecting layer high above the earth but it also posed many new questions . What was the constitution of this layer , how did it reflect the waves , was it the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so dramatically between day and night , did it change throughout the year ? Appleton would spend the rest of his life answering these questions . He developed a magneto-ionic theory based on the previous work of Lorentz and Maxwell to model the
