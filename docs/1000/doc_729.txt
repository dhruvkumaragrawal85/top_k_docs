III of France , and of the Duquesa de Alba . Domingo Cabarrus Quilty died before his father , Domingo Cabarrus Galabert and therefore did not become the third Count of Cabarrus , title that was inherited by his daughter , Paulina Cabarrus KIrkpatrick , as third Countess of Cabarrus . Francisco Cabarrus Lalanne also acquired the title of Viscount of Rabouilhet from Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea , Count of Aranda , originally for his other son , Francisco Cabarrus Galabert , but the early death of this son made him join both titles and up to today the present Counts of Cabarrus carry also the title of Viscounts of Rabouilhet . The town of Rabouilhet and its neighboring towns and countryside ( also included in the title deed ) are in the Lanquedoc region of France . His close friend , Francisco Goya , painted a full body portrait of him . This portrait is currently exhibited in the Bank of Spain building in Madrid . # Notes # @@340514 Infobox aircraft begin Infobox aircraft type The McDonnell Douglas MD-80 is a family of twin-engine , short- to medium-range , single-aisle commercial jet airliners .
