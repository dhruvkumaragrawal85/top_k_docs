Anionic detergents # Typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzenesulfonates . The alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic . Two different varieties have been popularized , those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups . The former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable . An estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for domestic markets . Bile acids , such as deoxycholic acid ( DOC ) , are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils . # Cationic detergents # Cationic detergents are similar to the anionic ones , with a hydrophobic component , but , instead of the anionic sulfonate group , the cationic surfactants have quaternary ammonium as the polar end . The ammonium center is positively charged . # Non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents # Non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged , hydrophilic headgroups . Typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside . Common examples of the former include Tween @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also known as ethoxylates or PEGylates and their metabolites , nonylphenol . Glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup . Examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides . HEGA and MEGA series detergents are similar , possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup . Zwitterionic detergents possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and 1 charged chemical groups . Examples include CHAPS . See surfactants for more applications . # Major applications of detergents # # Laundry detergents # One of the largest applications of detergents is for washing clothes . The formulations are complex , reflecting the diverse demands
