tonnes ( or 14 short tons ) of UF <sub> 6 </sub> . In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF <sub> 6 </sub> had accumulated by 1993 . In 2008 , 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth , Ohio and Paducah , Kentucky . The storage of DUF <sub> 6 </sub> presents environmental , health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . When UF <sub> 6 </sub> is exposed to water vapor in the air , it reacts with the moisture to produce UO <sub> 2 </sub> F <sub> 2 </sub> ( uranyl fluoride ) , a solid , and HF ( hydrogen fluoride ) , a gas , both of which are highly soluble and toxic . The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak , limiting further escape of depleted UF <sub> 6 </sub> . Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation . Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks , and are repainted and repaired as necessary . A tenfold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion , assuming DOE re-enriches the tails . This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services , and DOE 's access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity . There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States , including one in which 32 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF <sub> 6 </sub> and its reaction products . 1 person died , and while a few workers with higher exposure experienced short-term kidney damage ( e.g. , protein in the urine ) , none of them showed
