@ @ @ @ @ @ bill seeking to outlaw depleted uranium weapons , but it lapsed before approval by the Dil # Civilian applications # Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material , and as ballast . Examples include sailboat keels , as counterweights and as shielding in industrial radiography cameras . # Shielding in industrial radiography cameras # Industrial radiography cameras include a very high activity gamma radiation source ( typically Ir-192 with an activity above 10 TBq ) . Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source . Typically the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in polyurethane foam for thermal , mechanical and oxidation protection . and ZEUS detectors ) in due to its high density and natural radioactivity. # Health considerations # Normal functioning of the kidney , brain , liver , heart , and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure because , in addition to being weakly radioactive , uranium is a toxic metal , If DU particles do enter an individual , the type of danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend on the solubility of the particles . . Briefly , inhaled and insoluble means the DU particles will stick around in the lungs and attendant lymph nodes , presenting a radiological risk ; highly soluble means those particles are off to the kidneys , where toxicity is the issue . In military conflicts involving DU munitions , the major concern is inhalation of DU particles in aerosols arising from the impacts of DU-enhanced projectiles with their targets . When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn , they create depleted uranium oxides
