can be is the total-system inductance , including that of the capacitor , wires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be minimized . This is typically done using special capacitors , the shortest wires available , and electrical-leads with a lot of surface area but thin cross-sections . For extremely fast systems , low-inductance axial-leads , such as copper tubing , plastic-core wires , or even hollowed electrodes , may be used to decrease the total-system inductance . Dye lasers need very short pulses and sometimes use axial flashtubes , which have an annular shape with a large outer diameter , ring-shaped electrodes , and a hollow inner core , allowing both lower inductance and a dye cell to be placed like an axle through the center of the lamp . In contrast , changes in the input voltage or capacitance have no effect on discharge time , although they do have an effect on current density . As flash duration decreases , the electrical energy becomes concentrated into shorter pulses , so the current density will increase . Compensating for this usually requires lowering the capacitance as pulse duration decreases , and then raising the voltage proportionately in order to maintain a high enough energy-level . However , as pulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp , so the energy level must also be decreased to avoid destroying the lamp . The amount of power loading the glass can handle is the major mechanical limit . Even if the amount of energy ( joules ) that is used remains constant , electrical power ( wattage ) will increase in inverse proportion to a decrease in discharge time . Therefore , energy must be decreased along with the pulse
