moving on a circle . The adjective generalized distinguishes these parameters from the traditional use of the term coordinate to refer to Cartesian coordinates : for example , describing the location of the point on the circle using x and y coordinates . Although there may be many choices for generalized coordinates for a physical system , parameters are usually selected which are convenient for the specification of the configuration of the system and which make the solution of its equations of motion easier . If these parameters are independent of one another , then number of independent generalized coordinates is defined by the number of degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generalized coordinates are usually selected to provide the minimum number of independent coordinates that define the configuration of a system , which simplifies the formulation of Lagrange 's equations of motion . However , it can also occur that a useful set of generalized coordinates may be ' ' dependent ' ' , which means that they are related by one or more constraint equations . # Holonomic constraints # If the constraints introduce relations between the generalized coordinates ' ' q <sub> i </sub> ' ' , i=1 , ... , n and time , of the form , : <math> fj ( q1 , ... , qn , t ) = 0 , j=1 , ... , k , </math> they are called ' ' holonomic ' ' . These constraint equations define a manifold in the space of generalized coordinates ' ' q <sub> i </sub> ' ' , i=1 , ... , n , known as the configuration space It can be advantageous to choose independent generalized coordinates , as is done in Lagrangian mechanics , because this eliminates
