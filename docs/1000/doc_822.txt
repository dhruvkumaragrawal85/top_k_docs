@ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Solder seals bond the glass to the electrode with a solder for a very strong mechanical seal , but are limited to low temperature operation . Most common in laser pumping applications is the rod seal , where the rod of the electrode is wetted with another type of glass and then bonded directly to a quartz tube . This seal is very durable and capable of withstanding very high temperature and currents . The seal and the glass must have the same coefficient of expansion . For low electrode wear the electrodes are usually made of tungsten , which has the highest melting point of any metal , to handle the thermionic emission of electrons . Cathodes are often made from porous tungsten filled with a barium compound , which gives low work function ; the structure of cathode has to be tailored for the application . Anodes are usually made from pure tungsten , or , when good machinability is required , lanthanum-alloyed tungsten , and are often machined to provide extra surface area to cope with power loading . DC arc lamps often have a cathode with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the glass and to control temperature . Flashtubes usually have a cathode with a flattened radius , to reduce the incidence of hot spots and decrease sputter caused by peak currents , which may be in excess of 1000 amperes . Electrode design is also influenced by the average power . At high levels of average power , care has to be taken to achieve sufficient cooling of the electrodes . While anode temperature is of lower importance , overheating the cathode can greatly reduce the lamp 's life expectancy .
