east coast and inland of Australia and in some islands of New Guinea , is characterized by their very small size , which has side effects : because their mass-to-surface-area ratio is so small , heat escapes quicker from their bodies than it would in larger animals ( the larger the mass-to-surface-area ratio , the harder it is to get rid of heat ) . Therefore , when temperature drops or food is scarce , they have trouble maintaining their body temperature and they enter a state known as torpidity ( not to be confused with hibernation , which is not known in marsupials ) which can last between one day and two weeks .
