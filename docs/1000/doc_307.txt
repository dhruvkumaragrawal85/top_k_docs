that the decays were from dubnium-268 , the team repeated the reaction in August 2005 and separated the +4 and +5 fractions and further separated the +5 fractions into tantalum-like and niobium-like ones . Five SF activities were observed , all occurring in the +5 fractions and none in the tantalum-like fractions , proving that the product was indeed isotopes of dubnium . In a series of experiments between October 2010 February 2011 , scientists at the FLNR studied this reaction at a range of excitation energies . They were able to detect 21 atoms of <sup> 288 </sup> Uup and one atom of <sup> 289 </sup> Uup , from the 2n exit channel . This latter result was used to support the synthesis of ununseptium . The 3n excitation function was completed with a maximum at 8 pb . The data was consistent with that found in the first experiments in 2003. # Isotopes and nuclear properties # # Chemical properties # # Extrapolated chemical properties # # #Oxidation states# @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 ( VA ) in the Periodic Table , below bismuth . In this group , each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +V but with differing stability . For nitrogen , the +V state is very difficult to achieve due to the lack of low-lying d-orbitals and the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands . The +V state is well represented for phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony . However , for bismuth it is rare due to the reluctance of the 6s <sup> 2 </sup> electrons to participate in bonding . This effect is known as the
