According to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations ( waking dreams which are experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep ) . In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings ( Wiseman ' ' et al ' ' . 2003 ) came to the conclusion that people consistently report unusual experiences in haunted areas because of environmental factors , which may differ across locations . Some of these factors included the variance of local magnetic fields , size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware . Some researchers , such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University , Canada , have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields ( created , e.g. , by tectonic stresses in the Earth 's crust or solar activity ) could stimulate the brain 's temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings . Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings .
