years . These orchids are relatively easy to grow indoors , as long as conditions that mimic their natural habitats are created . Most species thrive in moderate to high humidity ( 50-70% ) , moderate temperatures ranging from 13 to 35 degrees Celsius and low light of 12,000 to 20,000 lux . Modern hybrids are typically easier to grow in artificial conditions than their parent species . # Taxonomy and systematics # The genus name ' ' Paphiopedilum ' ' was established by Ernst Hugo Heinrich Pfitzer in 1886 ; it is derived from Paphos ( a city in Cyprus , a place sacred to Aphrodite . It was said she landed at the site when rose from the sea as her birth. ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no paphiopedilum occurs on Cyprus &amp;ndash ; at least not as the genus is understood today . But it was long mixed up with its Holarctic relative ' ' Cypripedium ' ' , which indeed grows in the Mediterranean region . ' ' Paphiopedilum ' ' was finally decided to be a valid taxon in 1959 , but its use has become restricted to eastern Asian species in our time . # Subdivisions # The genus ' ' Paphiopedilum ' ' has been divided into several subgenera , and then further into sections and subsections : * Subgenus ' ' Parvisepalum ' ' * Subgenus ' ' Brachypetalum ' ' * Subgenus ' ' Polyantha ' ' ** Section ' ' Mastigopetalum ' ' ** Section ' ' Polyantha ' ' ** Section ' ' Mystropetalum ' ' ** Section ' ' Stictopetalum ' ' ** Section ' ' Paphiopedilum ' ' ** Section ' ' Ceratopetalum ' ' ** Section ' '
