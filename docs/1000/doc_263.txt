; see the article ' ' Lebesgue integration ' ' for a technical treatment from a mathematical point of view . Integration is a mathematical operation that corresponds to the informal idea of finding the area under the graph of a function . The first theory of integration was developed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC with his method of quadratures , but this could be applied only in limited circumstances with a high degree of geometric symmetry . In the 17th century , Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz discovered the idea that integration was intrinsically linked to differentiation , the latter being a way of measuring how quickly a function changed at any given point on the graph . This surprising relationship between two major geometric operations in calculus , differentiation and integration , is now known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to calculate a broad class of integrals for the first time . However , unlike Archimedes ' method , which was based on Euclidean geometry , mathematicians felt that Newton 's and Leibniz 's integral calculus did not have a rigorous foundation . In the 19th century , Augustin Cauchy developed epsilon-delta limits , and Bernhard Riemann followed up on this by formalizing what is now called the Riemann integral . To define this integral , one fills the area under the graph with smaller and smaller rectangles and takes the limit of the sums of the areas of the rectangles at each stage . For some functions , however , the total area of these rectangles does not approach a single number . As such , they have no Riemann integral . Lebesgue invented a new method of integration to solve this problem . Instead of using the
