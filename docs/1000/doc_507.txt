During the Middle Pleistocene period , **16;4001;ref The Middle Pleistocene period was ca. 781,000-126,000 years ago a large ice sheet built up across much of the East of England , reaching as far south as St Albans and Chelmsford , blocking the path of the proto-Thames . Glacial meltwater from the Anglian ice sheet , caused the Thames to divert southwards and flood the valley of the Mole-Wey river , thus adopting its present route through London . # Ecology # # Water quality # The water quality of the watercourses in the River Mole catchment area has improved dramatically since the 1990s . In 1990 the Environment Agency assessed only 23% of the watercourses as Grade B ( good ) or better , but by 2002 60% had reached this standard . Investment in the Sewage Treatment Works within the catchment area has improved the quality of the discharges into the river and modifications to the runway and apron drainage systems at Gatwick Airport means that surface water is diverted to aerated pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released into the river . There have been a number of high profile pollution incidents of the river in recent years : In 2003 , Gatwick Airport Ltd pleaded guilty to charges of allowing chemical pollution to enter the River Mole after a detergent , used to clean rubber and oil from the runway , was washed into Crawters Brook by airport workers . The Environment Agency estimated that up to 5200 fish of 14 different species were killed as the pollution spread downstream . The airport was fined 30,000 by Lewes Crown Court . In May 2003 , sewage leaking from a pump operated by Thames Water leaked into the Stanford Brook
