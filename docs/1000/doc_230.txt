place of DU since 1993 . Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant toxicological threat . In 2003 Professor Brian Spratt FRS , chairman of the Royal Society 's working group on depleted uranium , said : The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question , and the coalition needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed . A 2008 review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEDLINE through to the end of 2007 , including multiple cohort studies of veterans , found no consistent evidence of excess risks of neoplasms that could have some link to DU , and that the overall incidence of cancers is not increased in the cohort studies of Gulf war and Balkans veterans . Though a more comprehensive assessment is possible , a 2011 update on a cancer scare regarding Italian soldiers who had served in the Balkans found lower than expected incidence rates for all cancers , a finding consistent with lacking evidence of an increased cancer incidence among troops of other countries deployed in the areas of Iraq , Bosnia , and Kosovo , where armour-penetrating depleted uranium shells have been used . One particular subgroup of veterans that may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds . A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that , after a study period of 6 months , rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets , comparable
