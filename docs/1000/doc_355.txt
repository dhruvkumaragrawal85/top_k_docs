( January 14 , 1921 July 30 , 2006 ) was an American libertarian socialist author , orator , and philosopher . In 1958 , Murray Bookchin defined himself as an anarchist , seeing parallels between anarchism and ecology . His first book , ' ' Our Synthetic Environment , ' ' was published under the pseudonym Lewis Herber in 1962 , a few months before Rachel Carson 's ' ' Silent Spring ' ' . The book described a broad range of environmental ills but received little attention because of its political radicalism . His groundbreaking essay Ecology and Revolutionary Thought introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics . In 1968 he founded another group that published the influential ' ' Anarchos ' ' magazine , which published that and other innovative essays on post-scarcity and on ecological technologies such as solar and wind energy , and on decentralization and miniaturization . Lecturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ecology to the counterculture . ' ' Post-Scarcity Anarchism ' ' is a collection of essays written by Murray Bookchin and first published in 1971 by Ramparts Press . It outlines the possible form anarchism might take under conditions of post-scarcity . It is one of Bookchin 's major works , and its radical thesis provoked controversy for being utopian and messianic in its faith in the liberatory potential of technology . Bookchin argues that post-industrial societies are also post-scarcity societies , and can thus imagine the fulfillment of the social and cultural potentialities latent in a technology of abundance . The self-administration of society is now made possible by technological advancement and , when technology is used in an ecologically sensitive manner , the revolutionary potential of society will be much changed .
