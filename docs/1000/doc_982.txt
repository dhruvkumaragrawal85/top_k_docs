between the Cartesian and generalized coordinates : <math> xi = xi left ( q1 , q2 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yi = yi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) </math> : <math> zi = zi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) </math> are known , then these equations may be differentiated to provide the time-derivatives to use in the above kinetic energy equation : : <math> dot xi = frac ddt xi left ( q1 , q2 , ... , qn , t right ) . </math> It is important to remember that the kinetic energy must be measured relative to inertial coordinates . If the above method is used , it means only that the Cartesian coordinates need to be inertial , even though the generalized coordinates need not be . This is another considerable convenience of the use of generalized coordinates . -- # Applications of generalized coordinates # Such coordinates are helpful principally in Lagrangian mechanics , where the forms of the principal equations describing the motion of the system are unchanged by a shift to generalized coordinates from any other coordinate system .

While the generalized force is difficult to construct ' a priori ' , it may be quickly derived by determining the amount of work that would be done by all non-constraint forces if the system underwent a virtual displacement of <math> delta qi </math> , with all other generalized
