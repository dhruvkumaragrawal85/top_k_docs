He received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University ( Columbia College ) in 1958 . He earned his Master of Arts degree in 1960 from Harvard University . He earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree from Harvard University while working under direction of subsequent 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner William N. Lipscomb , Jr . Under Lipscomb 's direction the Extended Hckel method was developed by Lawrence Lohr and by Roald Hoffmann . This method was later extended by Hoffmann . He went to Cornell in 1965 and has remained there , becoming professor emeritus . # Chemistry interests # Hoffmann has investigated both organic and inorganic substances , developing computational tools and methods such as
