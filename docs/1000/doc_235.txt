Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence to link depleted uranium ( used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane ) to any of the reported health complaints . # Safety and environmental issues # About 95% of the depleted uranium produced until now is stored as uranium hexafluoride , ( D ) UF <sub> 6 </sub> , in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants . Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes ( or 14 US tons ) of UF <sub> 6 </sub> . In the U.S. alone , 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF <sub> 6 </sub> had accumulated by 1993 . In 2005 , 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth , Ohio , Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and Paducah , Kentucky. , The long-term storage of DUF <sub> 6 </sub> presents environmental , health , and safety risks because of its chemical instability . When UF <sub> 6 </sub> is exposed to moist air , it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO <sub> 2 </sub> F <sub> 2 </sub> ( uranyl fluoride ) and HF ( hydrogen fluoride ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks . The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades . There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States . The vulnerability of DUF <sub> 6 </sub> storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports . However , the U.S. government has been converting DUF <sub> 6 </sub> to solid uranium oxides for
