is to discover the policy that minimizes the cost ; i.e. , the MC for which the cost is minimal . ANNs are frequently used in reinforcement learning as part of the overall algorithm . Dynamic programming has been coupled with ANNs ( Neuro dynamic programming ) by Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis and applied to multi-dimensional nonlinear problems such as those involved in vehicle routing , natural resources management or medicine because of the ability of ANNs to mitigate losses of accuracy even when reducing the discretization grid density for numerically approximating the solution of the original control problems . Tasks that fall within the paradigm of reinforcement learning are control problems , games and other sequential decision making tasks . # Learning algorithms # Training a neural network model essentially means selecting one model from the set of allowed models ( or , in a Bayesian framework , determining a distribution over the set of allowed models ) that minimizes the cost criterion . There are numerous algorithms available for training neural network models ; most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and statistical estimation . Most of the algorithms used in training artificial neural networks employ some form of gradient descent . This is done by simply taking the derivative of the cost function with respect to the network parameters and then changing those parameters in a gradient-related direction . Evolutionary methods , These networks have also been used to diagnose prostate cancer . The diagnoses can be used to make specific models taken from a large group of patients compared to information of one given patient . The models do not depend on assumptions about correlations of different variables . Colorectal cancer has also been predicted using the neural networks . Neural
