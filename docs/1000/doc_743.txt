evaluating the possibility of developing a new JT8D for possible retrofit on the MD-80 . The engine would also be available on new build MD-80s . The 18000lbf kN to 19000lbf kN thrust -218B engine version shares a 98% commonality with the existing engine , with changes designed to reduce NOx , improve durability , and reduce noise levels by 3 dB . The 218B could be certificated in early to mid-1996 . The new engine , dubbed the 8000 , was to feature a new fan of increased diameter ( by 1.7 in ) , extended exhaust cone , a larger LP compressor , a new annular burner , and a new LP turbine and mixer . The initial thrust rating would be around 21700lbf kN thrust . A launch decision on the new engine was expected by mid-1994 , but never occurred . The MD-80 Advanced was also to offer a new flight deck instrumentation package and a completely new passenger compartment design . These changes would be available by retrofit to existing MD-80s , and was forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to incorporate the advanced flight deck of the MD-88 , including a choice of reference systems , with an inertial reference system as standard fitting and optional attitude-heading equipment . It was to be equipped with an electronic flight instrument system ( EFIS ) , an optional second flight management system ( FMS ) , light emitting diode ( LED ) dot matrix electronic engine and system displays . A Honeywell windshear computer and provision for an optional traffic-alert and collision avoidance system ( TCAS ) were also to be included . A new interior would have a 12% increase in overhead baggage space and stowage compartment lights that
