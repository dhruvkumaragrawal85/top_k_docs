@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2004 Review Information Regarding Uranium Toxicity ! Body system ! Human studies ! Animal studies ! ' ' In vitro ' ' Uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided . It will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium(IV) and soluble uranium ( VI ) salts . Soluble uranium salts are toxic . Uranium slowly accumulates in several organs , such as the liver , spleen , and kidneys . The World Health Organization has established a daily tolerated intake of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5 g/kg body weight , or 35 g for a 70 kg adult . Epidemiological studies and toxicological tests on laboratory animals point to it as being immunotoxic , and thus could not affect populations more than a few kilometers from target areas , and that such particles , if inhaled , would remain undissolved in the lung for a great length of time and thus could be detected in urine . Violently burning uranium droplets produce a gaseous vapor comprising about half of the uranium in their original mass . Uranyl ion contamination in uranium oxides has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Approximately 90 micrograms of natural uranium , on average , exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water , food and air . Most is in the skeleton . The biochemistry of depleted uranium is the same as natural uranium . # Radiological hazards # The primary radiation danger from pure depleted uranium is due to alpha particles , which do not travel far through air , and do not penetrate clothing . However , in a matter of a month or so , a
