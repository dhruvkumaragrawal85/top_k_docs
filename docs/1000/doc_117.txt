properties of drugs . The strength of drug delivery systems is their ability to alter the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of the drug . However , the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of nanomedicine is highly variable among different patients . When designed to avoid the body 's defence mechanisms , nanoparticles have beneficial properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger particles would have been cleared from the body , cells take up these nanoparticles because of their size . Complex drug delivery mechanisms are being developed , including the ability to get drugs through cell membranes and into cell cytoplasm . Efficiency is important because many diseases depend upon processes within the cell and can only be impeded by drugs that make their way into the cell . Triggered response is one way for drug molecules to be used more efficiently . Drugs are placed in the body and only activate on encountering a particular signal . For example , a drug with poor solubility will be replaced by a drug delivery system where both hydrophilic and hydrophobic environments exist , improving the solubility . Also , a drug may cause tissue damage , but with drug delivery , regulated drug release can eliminate the problem . If a drug is cleared too quickly from the body , this could force a patient to use high doses , but with drug delivery systems clearance can be reduced by altering the pharmacokinetics of the drug . Poor biodistribution is a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the particulates from drug delivery systems lower the volume of distribution and reduce the effect on non-target tissue . Potential nanodrugs will work by very specific and well-understood mechanisms ; one of the major impacts of nanotechnology
