have been abandoned , except for the invention of pykrete , a mixture of water and woodpulp which frozen together was stronger than plain ice , was slower melting , and of course would not sink . It has been suggested that Pyke was inspired by Inuit sleds reinforced with moss . This is probably apocryphal , as the material was originally described in a paper by Mark and Hohenstein in Brooklyn , NY . Pykrete could be machined like wood and cast into shapes like metal , and when immersed in water formed an insulating shell of wet wood pulp on its surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perutz found a problem : ice slowly flows , in what is known as plastic flow , and his tests showed that a pykrete ship would slowly sag unless it was cooled to -16 C. To accomplish this , the ship 's surface would have to be protected by insulation and it would need a refrigeration plant and a complicated system of ducts . Experiments on the viability of pykrete and the optimum composition of it were conducted by Perutz in a secret location underneath Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London . The research took place in a refrigerated meat locker behind a protective screen of frozen animal carcasses. # Scale model # The decision was made to build a large scale model at Jasper National Park in Canada to examine insulation and refrigeration techniques , and to see how it would stand up to artillery and explosives . At Lake Louise , Alberta , large ice blocks were constructed , and a small prototype was constructed at Patricia Lake , Alberta , measuring only 60 by 30 feet ( 18 by 9 m
