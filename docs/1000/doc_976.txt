the need for constraint equations . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unconstrained set . For example , when dealing with nonholonomic constraints or when trying to find the force due to any constraint , holonomic or not , dependent generalized coordinates must be employed . Sometimes independent generalized coordinates are called internal coordinates because they are mutually independent , otherwise unconstrained , and together give the position of the system . # Non-holonomic constraints # A mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives . Constraints of this type are known as non-holonomic . First-order non-holonomic constraints have the form : <math> gj ( q1 , .. , qn , dotq1 , .. , dotqn , t ) = 0 , j=1 , ... , k . </math> An example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife-edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector . Non-holonomic constraints can also involve next-order derivatives such as generalized accelerations. # Example : Simple pendulum # The relationship between the use of generalized coordinates and Cartesian coordinates to characterize the movement of a mechanical system can be illustrated by considering the constrained dynamics of a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass M hanging from a pivot point so that it is constrained to move on a circle of radius L. The position of the mass is defined by the coordinate vector r = ( x , y ) measured in the plane of the circle such that y is in the vertical direction . The coordinates x and y are related by the equation of the circle : <math> f ( x , y ) = x2+y2 - L2=0 ,
