of the element . On September 10 , 2013 , researchers from the same research group working in Darmstadt , Germany reported synthesis as well . # History # # Discovery profile # On February 2 , 2004 , synthesis of ununpentium was reported in ' ' Physical Review C ' ' by a team composed of Russian scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Laboratory . The team reported that they bombarded americium-243 with calcium-48 ions to produce four atoms of ununpentium . These atoms , they report , decayed by emission of alpha-particles to ununtrium in approximately 100 milliseconds. : + + 3 n + The DubnaLivermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discovery of ununpentium by conducting chemical experiments on the decay daughter <sup> 268 </sup> Db . In experiments in June 2004 and December 2005 , the dubnium isotope was successfully identified by milking the Db fraction and measuring any SF activities . Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed <sup> 268 </sup> Db which lends support to the assignment of Z=115 to the parent nuclei . Sergei Dmitriev from the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions ( FLNR ) in Dubna , Russia , has formally put forward their claim of discovery of ununpentium to the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party ( JWP ) . In 2011 , the IUPAC evaluated the DubnaLivermore results and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery . # Naming # Ununpentium is historically known as ' ' eka-bismuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary IUPAC systematic element name derived from the digits 115 , where un- represents Latin ' ' unum ' ' .
