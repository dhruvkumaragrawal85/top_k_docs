duration , to keep the pulsed power levels from rising too high . Quartz glass ( 1 millimeter thick per 1 second discharge ) can usually withstand a maximum of 160 watts per square centimeter of internal surface-area . Other glasses have a much lower threshold . Extremely fast systems , with inductance below critical damping ( 0.8 microhenries ) , usually require a shunt diode across the capacitor , to prevent current reversal ( ringing ) from destroying the lamp . If the pulse is allowed to ring through the lamp it will lengthen the flash , so the diode traps the ringing , allowing the lamp shut down at the correct time . The limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the anode , sputter caused by ion bombardment at the cathode , and the temperature gradients of the glass . Pulses that are too long can vaporize large amounts of metal from the cathode , while overheating the glass will cause it to crack lengthwise . For continuous operation the cooling is the limit . Discharge durations for common flashtubes range from 1 microsecond to tens of milliseconds , and can have repetition rates of hundreds of hertz . Flash duration can be carefully controlled with the use of an inductor . The flash that emanates from a xenon flashtube may be so intense that it can ignite flammable materials within a short distance of the tube . Carbon nanotubes are particularly susceptible to this spontaneous ignition when exposed to the light from a flashtube . Similar effects may be exploited for use in aesthetic or medical procedures known as intense pulsed light ( IPL ) treatments . IPL can be used for treatments such as hair removal and destroying lesions or
