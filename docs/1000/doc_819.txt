Flashtubes are made of a length of glass tubing with electrodes at either end and are filled with a gas that , when triggered , ionizes and conducts a high voltage pulse to produce the light . Flashtubes are used mostly for photographic purposes but are also employed in scientific , medical and industrial applications . # Construction # The lamp comprises a hermetically sealed glass tube , which is filled with a noble gas , usually xenon , and electrodes to carry electrical current to the gas . Additionally , a high voltage power source is necessary to energize the gas . A charged capacitor is usually used for this purpose , so as to allow very speedy delivery of very high electrical current when the lamp is triggered . # Glass envelopes # The glass envelope is most commonly a thin tube , often made of fused quartz , borosilicate or Pyrex , which may be straight @ @ @ @ @ @
