found to be hard to maintain and judged to be unsuccessful . Simultaneously , a SPG based on the T-34 medium tank was also developed . Initially the T-34 's chassis was selected for the 76.2 mm F-34 gun . This vehicle , the U-34 , was created in summer 1942 at the design bureau of UZTM ( Uralmashzavod Uralsky Machine Building factory ) by N. W. Kurin and G. F. Ksjunin . It was a tank destroyer with the same armament as the T-34 , but because of the absence of a turret , the vehicle was 70 cm lower , had thicker armour , and was 2 tonnes lighter . It did not enter production . UZTM then worked on combining features of the U-34 and the SG-122 . Initial design work was completed between July and August 1942 . The project emphasized minimizing modifications to the platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstructure , engine and transmission as the U-34 and was armed with a new 122 mm M-30S howitzer from F. F. Pietrow 's design bureau . This vehicle also used the same gun bed cover and mountings as the SG-122 , to keep costs low and simplify production . It had 45 mm thick frontal armour . The M-30S howitzer could be elevated or depressed between 3 and +26 and had 10 of traverse . The five-man crew consisted of a driver , gunner , commander and two loaders . On 25 November 1942 the first U-35 prototype was ready . Trials ran from 30 November to 19 December 1942 , and uncovered various faults in the design including insufficient elevation , a flawed shell transfer mechanism , poor ventilation for the crew compartment and the fact that the commander
