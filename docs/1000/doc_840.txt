open air discharge to produce the light . He was able to achieve a flash duration of 10 microseconds , and was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His colleague 's interest in the new flash apparatus soon provoked Edgerton to improve upon the design . The mercury lamp 's efficiency was limited by the coolest part of the lamp , causing them to perform better when very hot but poorly when cold . Edgerton decided to try a noble gas , feeling that it would not be as temperature dependent as mercury , and , in 1930 , he employed the General Electric company to construct some lamps using argon instead . The argon tubes were much more efficient , compact , and could be mounted near a reflector , concentrating their output . Slowly , camera designers began to take notice of the new technology and began to accept it . Edgerton received his first major order for the strobes from the Kodak company in 1940 . Afterward , he discovered that xenon was the most efficient of the noble gases , producing a spectrum very close to that of daylight , and xenon flashtubes became standard in most large photography sets . It was not until the 1970s that strobe units became portable enough to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented the ruby laser , a new demand for flashtubes began for use in lasers , and new interest was taken in the study of the lamps . # Safety # Flashtubes operate at high voltages , with currents high enough to be deadly . Under certain conditions , shocks as low as 1 joule have been reported to be lethal . The energy stored
