died , in 1971 , Hardin was deeply shaken by the loss . She traveled to New York for the funeral and rode in the family car . I think Louis would have found a way getting back at me if I had n't put Hardin in that car , his widow , Lucille , told Albertson . Returning to Chicago , Hardin felt that work on her autobiography could now continue , but the following month , performing at a televised memorial concert for Louis , Lil Hardin Armstrong collapsed at the piano . She died an hour later , aged 73. @@224514 imageskyline = CahirCastle06.JPG subdivisiontype = Country Cahir ( ; ) is a town in County Tipperary in Ireland . The town is best known for its castle and the Swiss Cottage . It is in the barony of Iffa and Offa West . # Location and access # For much of the twentieth century , Cahir stood at an intersection of two busy national roadways : the Dublin to Cork N8 , and the Limerick to Waterford N24 . The N8 was realigned in 1991 to run west of the town , while the old road through it was renumbered the R670 . Traffic from the N24 still left the town badly congested , however , until October 2007 when this road was also realigned to bypass Cahir to the north and east . The same road improvement scheme saw major changes to the N8 corridor : a new motorway , the M8 , was constructed west of the town between 2006 and 2008 . Access to Cahir from this motorway is gained at Junctions 10 and 11 . Cahir is on the LimerickWaterford regional railway line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
