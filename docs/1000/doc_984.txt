The present rupee has the ISO 4217 code ' ' NPR ' ' and is normally abbreviated with the sign . It is subdivided into 100 ' ' paisa ' ' . The issuance of the currency is controlled by the Nepal Rastra Bank . Several other currencies are also called rupee . # History # The rupee was introduced in 1932 , replacing the silver mohar at a rate of 2 mohar = 1 rupee . Initially , the rupee was called the ' ' mohru ' ' in Nepali . Its value was pegged to the Indian rupee in 1993 at a rate of 1.6 Nepalese rupees = 1 Indian rupee . # Coins # In 1932
