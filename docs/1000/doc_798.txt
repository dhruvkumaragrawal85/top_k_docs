He is taken before the governor , whose name is slightingly alluded to ( Monroe he set up for governor ) . The whole country turns out to see him . Gabriel makes a last speech in which he proclaims his own right name and that he is here today and gone tomorrow / I did not come for to stay for ever . He is taken to the gallows in a wagon drawn by four grey horses . Commenting with heavy irony that the execution was a Very sad loss to Major Prosser the verse concludes by describing Gabriel as the man who almost ruined old Virginny . @@372514 In the mathematical discipline of linear algebra , the Schur decomposition or Schur triangulation , named after Issai Schur , is a matrix decomposition . # Statement # The Schur decomposition reads as follows : if ' ' A ' ' is a ' ' n ' ' &amp;times ; ' ' n ' ' square matrix with complex entries , then ' ' A ' ' can be expressed as : <math> A = Q U Q-1 </math> where ' ' Q ' ' is a unitary matrix ( so that its inverse ' ' Q ' ' <sup> 1 </sup> is also the conjugate transpose ' ' Q ' ' * of ' ' Q ' ' ) , and ' ' U ' ' is an upper triangular matrix , which is called a Schur form of ' ' A ' ' . Since ' ' U ' ' is similar to ' ' A ' ' ,
