argon is also used . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat from transferring to the glass , but the flashes can often be shorter than a normal lamp of comparative size . The flash from a single ablative flashtube can also be more intense than multiple lamps . For these reasons , the most common use for the lamps is for the pumping of dye lasers . # Variable pulse width control # In addition , an insulated-gate bipolar transistor ( IGBT ) can be connected in series with both the trigger transformer and the lamp , making adjustable flash durations possible . An IGBT used for this purpose must be rated for a high pulsed current , so as to avoid over-current damage to the semiconductor junction . This type of system is used frequently in high average power laser systems , and can produce pulses ranging from 500 microseconds to over 20 milliseconds . It can be used with any of the triggering techniques , like external and series , and can produce square wave pulses . It can even be used with simmer voltage to produce a modulated continuous wave output , with repetition rates over 300 hertz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several kilowatts of average power output can be obtained . # Electrical requirements # The electrical requirements for a flashtube can vary , depending on the desired results . The usual method , once maximum power and the safe amount of operating energy is determined , is to pick a current density that will emit the desired spectrum , and let the lamp 's resistance determine the necessary combination of voltage and capacitance to produce it . The resistance in flashtubes varies greatly
