of a teacher , he was able to be educated at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums . He studied mathematics and astronomy from 1811 at the University of Gttingen under Carl Friedrich Gauss ; but he enlisted in the Hanseatic Legion for the campaign of 18131814 , serving as a sergeant in the artillery of the Prussian army , in Holstein and Mecklenburg . In 1814 he resumed his studies at the University but after Napoleon 's escape from Elba he returned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a lieutenant . Having returned to Gttingen in 1816 , he was at once appointed by Bernhardt von Lindenau as his assistant in the observatory of Seeberg near Gotha ( he had become acquainted with von Lindenau during his military service ) . There he completed his investigation of the comet of 1680 , for which the Cotta prize was awarded to him in 1817 by judges Gauss and Olbers ; he correctly assigned a period of 71 years to the comet of 1812 . That comet is now called ' ' 12P/Pons-Brooks ' ' . Following a suggestion by Jean-Louis Pons , who suspected one of the three comets discovered in 1818 to be the same one already discovered by him in 1805 , Encke began to calculate the orbital elements of this comet . At this time , all the known comets had an orbital period of seventy years and more , with an aphelion far beyond the orbit of Uranus . The most famous comet of this family was Comet Halley with its period of seventy-six years . So the orbit of the comet discovered by Pons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a period of 3.3 years
