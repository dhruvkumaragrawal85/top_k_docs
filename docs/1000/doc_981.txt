Notice that a motion embedded in three dimensions has been reduced to only one dimension . # Motion on a surface # A point mass constrained to a surface has two degrees of freedom , even though its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sphere , a good choice of coordinates would be : : <math> lbrace q1 , q2 rbrace = lbrace theta , phi rbrace </math> , where and are the angle coordinates familiar from spherical coordinates . The ' ' r ' ' coordinate has been effectively dropped , as a particle moving on a sphere maintains a constant radius . -- # Generalized velocities and kinetic energy # Each generalized coordinate <math> qi </math> is associated with a generalized velocity <math> dot qi </math> , defined as : : <math> dot qi=dqi over dt </math> The kinetic energy of a particle is : <math> T = frac m2 left ( dot x2 + dot y2 + dot z2 right ) </math> . In more general terms , for a system of <math> p </math> particles with <math> n </math> degrees of freedom , this may be written : <math> T =sumi=1 p frac mi2 left ( dot xi2 + dot yi2 + dot zi2 right ) </math> .
