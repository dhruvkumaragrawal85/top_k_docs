areas of rectangles , which put the focus on the domain of the function , Lebesgue looked at the codomain of the function for his fundamental unit of area . Lebesgue 's idea was to first define measure , for both sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the integral for what he called simple functions ; measurable functions that take only finitely many values . Then he defined it for more complicated functions as the least upper bound of all the integrals of simple functions smaller than the function in question . Lebesgue integration has the property that every function defined over a bounded interval with a Riemann integral also has a Lebesgue integral , and for those functions the two integrals agree . Furthermore , every bounded function on a closed bounded interval has a Lebesgue integral and there are many functions with a Lebesgue integral that have no Riemann integral . As part of the development of Lebesgue integration , Lebesgue invented the concept of measure , which extends the idea of length from intervals to a very large class of sets , called measurable sets ( so , more precisely , simple functions are functions that take a finite number of values , and each value is taken on a measurable set ) . Lebesgue 's technique for turning a measure into an integral generalises easily to many other situations , leading to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficient in one respect . The Riemann integral generalises to the improper Riemann integral to measure functions whose domain of definition is not a closed interval . The Lebesgue integral integrates many of these functions ( always reproducing the same answer when it did ) , but
