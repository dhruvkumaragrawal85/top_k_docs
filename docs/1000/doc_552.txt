found it just as exciting as punk rock . He then attended the University of Southern California , where he earned a B.S. in biology and an M.S. in molecular biology , and commenced a Ph.D . in molecular biology . After the success of The Offspring , he suspended his candidature to focus on music . Holland has said that , at 40 years of age , he would rather be a professor at a university than play music . As of 2013 , Holland is a doctoral student at the Laboratory of Viral Oncology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is supervised by Professor Suraiya Rasheed . In March 2013 , Holland and co-authors published a paper in ' ' PLoS One ' ' regarding microRNA in HIV genomes , titled Identification of Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within the Protein-Encoding Genes of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus . The original academic paper describes the use of computational molecular biological ( ' ' in silico ' ' ) approaches to identify microRNA-like sequences in HIV . These sequences are suggested to have evolved to self-regulate survival of the virus in the host by evading its immune responses and thus influence the persistence , replication , and pathogenicity of HIV. # Musical career # Holland 's early influences include Aerosmith , The Beatles , Bob Dylan , KISS , Bob Marley , Queen , and The Rolling Stones .
