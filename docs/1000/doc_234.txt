, in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury , it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels , but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up . Pier Roberto Danesi , then-director of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) Seibersdorf +Laboratory , stated in 2002 that There is a consensus now that DU does not represent a health threat . A 2005 study by Sandia National Laboratories ' Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War . Marshall 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics . Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium . Chemical effects , including potential reproductive issues , associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper . # Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions # Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain . These elevated readings appear to coincide with Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan , and the Shock and Awe bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War . # Other contamination cases # On October 4 , 1992 , an El Al Boeing 747-F cargo aircraft Flight 1862 , crashed into an apartment building in Amsterdam . Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires .
