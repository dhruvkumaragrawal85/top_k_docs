lasting damage from the exposure to uranium . The U.S. government has been converting DUF <sub> 6 </sub> to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal . Such disposal of the entire DUF <sub> 6 </sub> inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million . : : : : : : : : World depleted uranium inventory : : : : : : : : : : <small> </small> # Military applications # Depleted uranium is very dense ; at 19,050 kg/m , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less dense than tungsten and gold , and 84% as dense as osmium or iridium , which are the densest known substances under standard ( i.e. , Earth-surface ) pressures . Consequently a DU projectile of given mass has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile , with less aerodynamic drag and deeper penetration due to a higher pressure at point of impact . DU projectile ordnance is often inherently incendiary because of its pyrophoric property . # Armor plate # Because of its high density , depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor , sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate . For instance , some late-production M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams tanks built after 1998 have DU reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret , and there is a program to upgrade the rest ( see Chobham armor ) . # Nuclear weapons # Depleted uranium is used as a tamper in fission bombs . # Ammunition # Most military use of depleted uranium has been as 30 mm caliber ordnance , primarily the 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the A-10
