. The sudden change from impermeable Wealden Clay to permeable chalk and the increased gradient of the river ( which drops 15 m in the six mile ( 10 km ) stretch between Brockham and Leatherhead , compared to 3 m in 12 mi between Horley and Brockham ) allow the water table to drop below the bed of the river . Water is able to flow out of the river through swallow holes in the bed and banks , decreasing the volume of water carried in the main channel . The course of the river through Norbury Park was partially straightened when the Epsom to Horsham railway was built in 1837 , with the removal of a small meander north of Westhumble . The meander was reinstated in 1997 , in an attempt to enhance this area of the Park , although it has since become blocked by silt . The entirety of the Mole Gap lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty . # Lower Mole # At Leatherhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow across impermeable London Clay , winding towards Cobham . The water table rises at this point and much of the water which drained out of the channel through the chalk returns through springs in the riverbed . The aquifer at Fetcham is the only one in the entire catchment area . The next major tributary , The Rye , ( which drains Ashtead ) joins to the north of Leatherhead , before the river is crossed by the M25 motorway . At Cobham the river swings round in a pronounced axe-head meander skirting Painshill Landscape Garden , where a 35 ft diameter waterwheel raises water 5 m from the river to feed the ornamental lake
