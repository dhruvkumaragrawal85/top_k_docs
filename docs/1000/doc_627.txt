During WWI Hberlin was a regiment commander and was stationed with his troops in the Swiss Alps . - In those days it was strongly prohibited for the soldier in charge of guarding horse carriages to ride on top of the carriage , instead the soldier had the duty to run behind the carriage in case anything of the load fell off during the transportation . Needless to say , the soldier on duty was not too thrilled with this task , especially when the carriage was empty after delivering the goods and still he was not allowed to ride on it . So one day a guard of Hberlins regiment sat next up to the coachman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goods at the designated area . They were going on a mountainous road which had many turns , when all of a sudden Hberlin appeared out of nowhere and harshly questioned the guard why he was sitting on the coach instead of running alongside it .
