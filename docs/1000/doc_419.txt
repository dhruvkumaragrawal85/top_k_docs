Route 31 , the longest road through Hebron , cuts across diagonally from Route 30 connecting West Hebron to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two major watersheds whose waters travel great distances in opposite directions , only to rejoin ultimately in the Atlantic Ocean . The formal valleys and watersheds to which Hebron belongs are the following : Champlain Valley / Lake George Watershed02010001 ; Hudson River Valley / Hudson-Hoosic Watershed02020003 . Waters in the northernmost part of Hebron drain via the Mettawee River north into Lake Champlain , where they mix with waters from Lake George ( ' ' Horican ' ' ) and then flow into the Saint Lawrence River ( ' ' Kaniatarowanenneh ' ' ) .
