In 1910 Lebesgue moved to the Sorbonne as a matre de confrences , being promoted to professor starting with 1919 . In 1921 he left the Sorbonne to become professor of mathematics at the Collge de France , where he lectured and did research for the rest of his life . In 1922 he was elected a member of the Acadmie franaise . Henri Lebesgue died on 26 July 1941 in Paris . # Mathematical career # Lebesgue 's first paper was published in 1898 and was titled Sur l'approximation des fonctions . It dealt with Weierstrass ' theorem on approximation to continuous functions by polynomials . Between March 1899 and April 1901 Lebesgue published six notes in ' ' Comptes Rendus . ' ' The first of these , unrelated to his development of Lebesgue integration , dealt with the extension of Baire 's theorem to functions of two variables . The next five dealt with surfaces applicable to a plane , the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given bound , and the final note gave the definition of Lebesgue integration for some function f(x) . Lebesgue 's great thesis , ' ' Intgrale , longueur , aire ' ' , with the full account of this work , appeared in the Annali di Matematica in 1902 . The first
