Cloud albedo varies from less than 10% to more than 90% and depends on drop sizes , liquid water or ice content , thickness of the cloud , and the sun 's zenith angle . The smaller the drops and the greater the liquid water content , the greater the cloud albedo , if all other factors are the same . Low , thick clouds ( such as stratocumulus ) primarily reflect incoming solar radiation , causing it to have a high albedo , whereas high , thin clouds ( such as Cirrus ) tend to transmit it to the surface but then trap outgoing infrared radiation , causing it to have low albedo . It contributes to the greenhouse effect . @@49514 birthplace = Beauvais , Oise , France deathplace = Paris Henri Lon Lebesgue ForMemRS ( ; June 28 , 1875 July 26 , 1941 ) was a French mathematician most famous for his theory of integration , which was a generalization of the 17th century concept of integrationsumming the area between an axis
