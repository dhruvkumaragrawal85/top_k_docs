vary from those with only one or two layers of single direction logic , to complicated multiinput many directional feedback loops and layers . On the whole , these systems use algorithms in their programming to determine control and organization of their functions . Most systems use weights to change the parameters of the throughput and the varying connections to the neurons . Artificial neural networks can be autonomous and learn by input from outside teachers or even self-teaching from written-in rules . # Theoretical properties # # Computational power # The multi-layer perceptron ( MLP ) is a universal function approximator , as proven by the Cybenko theorem . However , the proof is not constructive regarding the number of neurons required or the settings of the weights . Work by Hava Siegelmann and Eduardo D. Sontag has provided a proof that a specific recurrent architecture with rational valued weights ( as opposed to full precision real number-valued weights ) has the full power of a Universal Turing Machine to detecting credit card fraud . Technology writer Roger Bridgman commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networks , for instance , are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven , ( what has n't ? ) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked : the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be an opaque , unreadable table ... valueless as a scientific resource . In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology , Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers . An unreadable table that a useful machine
