OD ) . **16;3929;ref The gauging station south of Gatwick Airport was installed in 2005 , replacing an earlier station located 200 m ( 200 yds ) downstream . The mean flow is 0.33m3/s cuft/s and the river ran dry at this point for the first time in the summer of 1995 . The Mole runs under the airport runway in a culvert completed in 1985 . The course of the Mole within the airport perimeter has been altered several times since commercial flights began in 1945 ; however the meanders visible on the 1839 tithe map in the 1.5 km stretch immediately north of the runway were reinstated in 1999 , in a 1.2 million project to facilitate airport expansion . The Mole enters Surrey to the south of Horley , where it meets the Gatwick Stream , a tributary draining Worth Forest to the southeast of Crawley . The second-largest Sewage Treatment Works ( STW ) in the Mole catchment is located on the Gatwick Stream 3km mi upstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 megalitres ( 15,000 m <sup> 3 </sup> ) of water per day , and in prolonged dry periods it accounts for up to 75% of the flow of the Mole downstream of the confluence . The mean flow measured at Horley gauging station ( 52 m above OD ) is 1.40m3/s cuft/s . The Mole passes Horley to the west , flowing north towards Sidlow and entering a largely rural area . 0.7kmmi 1 south of Sidlow the mean flow is measured as 2.21m3/s cuft/s at Kinnersley Manor gauging station ( 48 m above OD ) . The Earlswood Brook , a tributary draining the urban area of Reigate and Redhill , joins the Mole at Sidlow .
