The Royal Society DU Working Group concluded in 2002 that there were very low health risks associated with the use of depleted uranium , though also ventured that , in extreme conditions and under worst-case assumptions lung and kidney damage could occur , and that in worst-case scenarios high local levels of uranium could occur in food or water that could have adverse effects on the kidney . In 2003 , the Royal Society issued another urgent call to investigate the actual health and environmental impact of depleted uranium . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no elevated risks of cancer generally , nor of any specific cancers in particular , though recommended follow up studies . According to the World Health Organization , a radiation dose from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass ; the radiological dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes. # Gulf War syndrome and soldier complaints # Since 1991 , the year the Gulf War ended , veterans and
