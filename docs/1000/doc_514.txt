the water removed from the river by the swallow holes is returned to the channel at Leatherhead . The chalk aquifer also feeds the springs at the southern end of Fetcham Mill Pond , which have never been known to run dry . A survey in March 1883 estimated that the Fetcham springs were producing about 3.6 million gallons of water ( 16,000 m <sup> 3 </sup> ) every day . A second survey in 1948 estimated that the same springs were yielding about 5 million gallons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The water table in the chalk of the Wey Gap is significantly higher than might be expected from natural rainwater percolation alone . It has been suggested that a proportion of the excess water originates from the Mole Gap . # Lower Mole **27;4077;span ( geology ) </span> # At Leatherhead the river leaves the chalk bedrock , moving onto London Clay . The river meanders across an alluvial plain between 400 and 800 m wide towards Cobham , where it begins to descend to a lower flood plain which in turn broadens to the axehead meander at Painshill Park . At the east end of Painshill Park , the lower flood plain abruptly narrows to form a narrow trench about 60 m wide , in which the river runs northwards for 6.5km mi towards Hersham , where the river enters the flood plain of the River Thames . There are a series of gravel deposits laid down by the river above the London Clay between Cobham , Walton-on-Thames and Esher . The depth of the deposits generally varies from 2.5mft sigfig=1 to 7mft sigfig=1 , and the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron oxide
