Argon has many strong peaks at 670 , 710 , 760 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks around 650 , 700 , 850 , and 880 nm . As current densities become higher , the output of continuum radiation will increase more than the spectral line radiation at a rate 20% greater , and output center will shift toward the visual spectrum . At greybody current densities there is only a slight difference in the spectrum emitted by various gases . At very high current densities , all gases will begin to operate as blackbody radiators , with spectral outputs centered in the near-UV . Heavier gases exhibit higher resistance , and therefore , have a higher value for K <sub> o </sub> . Impedance , being defined as the resistance required to change energy into work , is higher for heavier gases , and as such , the heavier gases are much more efficient than the lighter ones . Helium and neon are far too light to produce an efficient flash . Krypton can be as good as 40% efficient , but requires up to a 70% increase in pressure to achieve this . Argon can be up to 30% efficient , but requires an even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage drop between the electrodes , formed by the spark streamer , may be greater than the capacitor voltage . These lamps often need a boost voltage during the trigger phase , to overcome the extremely high trigger impedance . Nitrogen , in the form of air , has been used in flashtubes in home made dye lasers , but the nitrogen and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes , and themselves , causing premature
