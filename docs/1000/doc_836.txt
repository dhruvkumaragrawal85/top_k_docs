moles. # Lifetime # The lifetime of a flashtube depends on both the energy level used for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulse duration of the lamp . Failures can be catastrophic , causing the lamp to shatter , or they can be gradual , reducing the performance of the lamp below a usable rating . # Catastrophic failure # Catastrophic failure can occur from two separate mechanisms : energy and heat . When too much energy is used for the pulse duration , structural failure of the glass envelope can occur . Flashtubes produce an electrical arc flash contained in a glass tube . As the arc develops a supersonic shock-wave forms , traveling radially from the center of the arc and impacting the inner wall of the tube . If the energy level is low enough , a soft tap against the glass is all that will be heard . However , if the energy level used equals the explosion energy rating of the lamp , the impacting shock wave will fracture the glass , rupturing the tube . The resulting explosion creates a loud , sonic shock-wave , and may throw shattered glass several feet . The explosion energy is calculated by multiplying the internal surface-area of the lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass . Power loading is determined by the type and thickness of the glass , and the cooling method that is used . Power loading is measured in watts per centimeter squared . However , since the pulsed-power level increases as the flash duration decreases , the explosion energy must then be decreased in direct proportion to the square root of discharge time . Failure from heat is usually caused
