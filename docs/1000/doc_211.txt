the past as Q-metal , depletalloy or D-38 ) is uranium with a lower content of the fissile isotope U-235 than natural uranium . : Depleted uranium possesses only 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium , having been ' depleted ' of much of its most highly radioactive U <sup> 234 </sup> and U <sup> 235 </sup> isotopes . ( Natural uranium is about 0.72% U-235the fissile isotope , and the DU used by the U.S. Department of Defense contain less than 0.3% U-235 ) . Uses of DU take advantage of its very high density of 19.1 g/cm <sup> 3 </sup> ( 68.4% denser than lead ) . Civilian uses include counterweights in aircraft , radiation shielding in medical radiation therapy and industrial radiography equipment and containers used to transport radioactive materials . Military uses include defensive armor plating and armor-piercing projectiles . Most depleted uranium arises as a byproduct of the production of enriched uranium for use in nuclear reactors and in the manufacture of nuclear weapons . Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the uranium isotope supporting the fission chain reaction ) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium , in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium . U-238 has a much longer halflife than the lighter isotopes , and DU therefore emits less alpha radiation than the same mass of natural uranium : the US Defense Department states DU used in US munitions has 60% of the radioactivity of natural uranium . Since the U-235 content of nuclear reactor fuel is reduced by fission , uranium recovered by nuclear reprocessing from spent nuclear reactor fuel made
