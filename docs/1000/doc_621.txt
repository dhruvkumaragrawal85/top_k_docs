method is to count a half bathroom as .5 and then add this to the number of full bathrooms ( e.g. , 2.5 baths would mean 2 full baths and 1 half bath ) . The other , newer method is to put the number of full bathrooms to the left side of the decimal point and to put the number of half bathrooms to the right of the decimal point ( e.g. , 2.1 would mean 2 full baths and 1 half bath ; 3.2 would mean 3 full baths and 2 half baths ) . # Design considerations # The design of a bathroom must account for the use of both hot and cold water , in significant quantities , for cleaning the human body .

The use of ceramic or glass , as well as smooth plastic materials , is common in bathrooms for their ease of cleaning . Such surfaces are often cold to the touch , however , and so water-resistant bath mats or even bathroom carpets may be used on the floor to make the room more comfortable .

Electrical appliances , such as lights , heaters , and heated towel rails , generally need to be installed as fixtures , with permanent connections
