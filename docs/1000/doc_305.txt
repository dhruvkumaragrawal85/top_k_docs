For more , see systematic element name . # Current and future experiments # The team at Dubna are currently running another series of experiments on the <sup> 243 </sup> Am ( <sup> 48 </sup> Ca , xn ) reaction . They are attempting to complete the 4n excitation function and confirm the data for <sup> 287 </sup> Uup . They are also hoping to identify some decays from the 2n and 5n exit channels . This reaction will run until the Christmas shutdown . The FLNR also have future plans to study light isotopes of element 115 using the reaction <sup> 241 </sup> Am + <sup> 48 </sup> Ca . A team of researchers at Lund University announced they had corroborated the 2004 findings in August 2013 by shooting calcium ions into a thin film of americium . Researchers at the GSI Helmholtz in Darmstadt , Germany reported the successful synthesis of ununpentium using the same reaction just two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target-projectile combinations # The table below contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with Z=115 . Each entry is a combination for which calculations have provided estimates for cross section yields from various neutron evaporation channels .
