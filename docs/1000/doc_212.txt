from natural uranium will have a lower-than-natural U-235 concentration . Such ' reactor-depleted ' material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct DU , and can be distinguished from it by the presence of U-236 . Trace transuranics ( another indicator of the use of reprocessed material ) have been reported to be present in some US tank armor . The use of DU in munitions is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects . Normal functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure , because uranium is a toxic metal . It is only weakly radioactive because of its long radioactive half-life ( 4.468 billion years for uranium-238 , 700 million years for uranium-235 ) . The biological half-life ( the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body ) for uranium is about 15 days . The aerosol or spallation frangible powder produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites , leading to possible inhalation by human beings . The actual level of acute and chronic toxicity of DU is also a point of medical controversy . Several studies using cultured cells and laboratory rodents suggest the possibility of leukemogenic , and of genetic , reproductive , and neurological effects from chronic exposure . A 2005 epidemiology review concluded : In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU . The World Health Organization , the directing and coordinating authority for health within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , developmental , or carcinogenic effects have been reported
