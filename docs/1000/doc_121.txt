magnetic nanoparticles to vibrate and rupture the liposome , dispersing the drug in its free form throughout the tumor . The result showed that the nano treatment was more effective in halting tumor growth than the standard treatment with doxorubicin . It is also less harmful to healthy cells since only 5% to 10% of the standard dose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( PEG ) carrying payload of antibiotics at its core could swift charge thus allowing them to target bacterial infection more precisely inside the body , a group of MIT researchers reported . The nanoparticles , containing a sub-layer of pH sensitive chains of the amino acid histidine , carry a slightly negative charge when circulating in the blood stream , can evade detection and clearing by the immune system . When they encounter an infection site the particles gain a positive charge provoked by the slightly acidic environment at the infection sites , allowing them to bind to the negatively charged bacterial cell walls and release antibiotics at locally high concentration . This nano delivery system can potentially destroy bacteria even if it has developed resistance to antibiotics because of the targeted high dose and prolonged release of the drug . Although a lot of work is still needed , the researchers believe that it points to a new direction of using nanotechnology to treat infectious disease . *Using the biomimetic strategy , researchers in the Harvard University Wyss Institute demonstrated in a mouse model that the drug coated nanoparticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions in the blood vessels just like the platelets do . Aggregates of biodegradable nanoparticles coated with tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , each about the size of a platelet
