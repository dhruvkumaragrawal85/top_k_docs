tracts , entitled ' ' Die Entfernung der Sonne ' ' ( The distance to the sun , 1822-1824 ) . In 1822 he became director of the Seeberg observatory , and in 1825 was promoted to a corresponding position at Berlin , where a new observatory , built under his superintendence and with the support of Alexander von Humboldt and King Frederick William III of Prussia , was inaugurated in 1835 . Mostly on the recommendation of Bessel , Encke became director of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the preparation of the star maps of the Academy ( 18301859 ) ; beginning in 1830 , he edited and greatly improved the ' ' Astronomisches Jahrbuch ' ' ; and he issued four volumes of the ' ' Astronomische Beobachtungen auf der Sternwarte zu Berlin ' ' ( Observations of the Berlin observatory , 18401857 ) . Within the following time Encke was involved in the discovery and orbital parameter determination of other short periodic comets and asteroids . In 1837 , Encke described a broad variation in the brightness of the A Ring of Saturn . The Encke Gap was later named in honor of his observations of Saturn 's rings . In 1844 , Encke became professor for astronomy at the University of Berlin . Much labor was bestowed by him upon facilitating the computation of the movements of the asteroids . With this end in view he expounded to the Berlin Academy in 1849 a mode of determining an elliptic orbit from three observations , and communicated to that body in 1851 a new method of calculating planetary perturbations by means of rectangular coordinates ( republished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' ,
