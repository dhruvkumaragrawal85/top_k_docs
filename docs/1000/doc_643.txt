a gene pool was established to preserve the tamaraw 's numbers . However , the project was not successful as only one offspring , named Kali , was produced . As of 2011 , Kali is the only surviving animal in the gene pooling project . The project was also not improved as the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau shown that the tamaraws were already breeding in the wild . Cloning was not implemented for conservation as the Department of Environment and Natural Resource argued that such measures would diminish the genetic diversity of the species . A small subpopulation of tamaraw has been found within the confines of the Mt . Iglit Game Refuge and Bird Sanctuary on the same island of Mindoro . As of May 2007 , ' ' Bubalus mindorensis ' ' is on ' ' Appendix I ' ' of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species where it has been since the species was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With the listing , CITES recognizes the species as critically endangered and threatened with extinction . Thus , international commercial trade in the species or any derivatives of which , such as the meat , horns or flesh is considered illegal . While commercial trade in the species is prohibited , exchange for non-commercial reasons such as scientific research is allowed . # Importance to humans # # Economical and commercial value # While not as heavily exploited as other large , endangered mammals , the tamaraw population on Mindoro was subject to some harvesting pressure from subsistence hunters before conservation efforts were spurred towards the latter half of the 20th century . The IUCN has described this as still ongoing in their 2006 Red List report .
