</math> that constrains the movement of M. This equation also provides a constraint on the velocity components , : <math> dotf ( x , y ) =2xdotx + 2ydoty = 0 . </math> Now introduce the parameter , that defines the angular position of M from the vertical direction . It can be used to define the coordinates x and y , such that : <math> mathbfr= ( x , y ) = ( Lsintheta , -Lcostheta ) . </math> The use of to define the configuration of this system avoids the constraint provided by the equation of the circle . # Virtual work # Notice that the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual Cartesian coordinates , : <math> mathbfF= ( 0 , -mg ) , </math> where g is the acceleration of gravity . The virtual work of gravity on the mass m as it follows the trajectory r is given by : <math> delta W = mathbfFcdotdelta mathbfr . </math> The variation r can be computed in terms of the coordinates x and y , or in terms of the parameter , : <math> delta mathbfr = ( delta x , delta y ) = ( Lcostheta , Lsintheta ) deltatheta . </math> Thus , the virtual work is given by : <math> delta W = -mgdelta y = -mgLsinthetadeltatheta . </math> Notice that the coefficient of y is the y-component of the applied force . In the same way , the coefficient of is known as the generalized force along generalized coordinate , given by : <math> Ftheta = -mgLsintheta. </math> # Kinetic energy # To complete the analysis consider the kinetic energy T of the mass , using the velocity , : <math> mathbfv= ( dotx , doty )
