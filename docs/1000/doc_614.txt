earthquakes can inflict heavy damage , particularly because such areas are not accustomed to earthquakes and buildings are usually not seismically retrofitted . Examples of damaging intraplate earthquakes are the devastating Gujarat earthquake in 2001 , the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes , the 1811-1812 earthquakes in New Madrid , Missouri , and the 1886 earthquake in Charleston , South Carolina . # Fault zones within tectonic plates # The surface of the Earth is made up of seven primary and eight secondary tectonic plates , plus dozens of tertiary microplates . The large plates move very slowly , owing to convection currents within the mantle below the crust . Because they do not all move in the same direction , plates often directly collide or move laterally along each other , a tectonic environment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments ; most occur on faults near plate margins . By definition , intraplate earthquakes do not occur near plate boundaries , but along faults in the normally stable interior of plates . These earthquakes often occur at the location of ancient failed rifts , because such old structures may present a weakness in the crust where it can easily slip to accommodate regional tectonic strain . Compared to earthquakes near plate boundaries , intraplate earthquakes are not well understood , and the hazards associated with them may be difficult to quantify . # Historic examples # Historic examples of intraplate earthquakes include those in Mineral , Virginia in 2011 ( estimated magnitude 5.8 ) , New Madrid in 1811 and 1812 ( estimated magnitude as high as 8.1 ) , the Boston ( Cape Ann ) earthquake of 1755 ( estimated magnitude 6.0 to 6.3 ) , earthquakes felt in New York City in
