A ' ' ( just because the Frobenius norm of A is equal to the Frobenius norm of ' ' U ' ' = ' ' D ' ' + ' ' N ' ' ) . It is clear that if ' ' A ' ' is a normal matrix , then ' ' U ' ' from its Schur decomposition must be a diagonal matrix and the column vectors of ' ' Q ' ' are the eigenvectors of ' ' A ' ' . Therefore , the Schur decomposition extends the spectral decomposition . In particular , if ' ' A ' ' is positive definite , the Schur decomposition of ' ' A ' ' , its spectral decomposition , and its singular value decomposition coincide . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of matrices can be simultaneously triangularized , i.e. there exists a unitary matrix ' ' Q ' ' such that , for every ' ' A <sub> i </sub> ' ' in the given family , ' ' Q A <sub> i </sub> Q* ' ' is upper triangular . This can be readily deduced from the above proof . Take element ' ' A ' ' from ' ' A <sub> i </sub> ' ' and again consider an eigenspace ' ' V <sub> A </sub> ' ' . Then ' ' V <sub> A </sub> ' ' is invariant under all matrices in ' ' A <sub> i </sub> ' ' . Therefore all matrices in ' ' A <sub> i </sub> ' ' must share one common eigenvector in ' ' V <sub> A </sub> ' ' . Induction then proves the claim . As a corollary , we have that every commuting family of
